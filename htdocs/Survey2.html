<P>&#160; The New Mexico Network for Women in Science and Engineering is at a critical crossroads. The organization was founded in 1979 to encourage entry of women into science and engineering careers. Although our Expanding Your Horizons conferences have been a huge success over the years, generating lots of interest among members, lately we have been suffering from low attendance at meetings and activities and diminishing membership. Our membership this past year dropped by 9 members, which is almost 10% of the total 97 members. These trends, as well as comments from people who have decided not to renew their membership, have prompted us to conduct this survey. We very much want to know what you, the members and former members, want this organization to be so that we can, together, chart future directions that will make this organization the best networking resource for women possible. In the coming months, we would like to explore ideas for new initiatives that will involve more of the membership. Please please please take time to respond. The future, indeed the survival, of the organization depends on it. Please be honest. We need your ideas!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I>As a special reward for your efforts, we will send out an NMNWSE canvas bag with our beautiful new logo to the first 25 people to send in their completed surveys!</B></I></P>
