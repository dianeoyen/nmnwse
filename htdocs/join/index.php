      <h2> Why join NMNWSE? </h2>
      <p>
        Membership in the network helps to support all of the efforts
        of the group. Members attend chapter meetings, receive the printed
        version of <a href="http://nmnwse.org/News.php">The Network News</a>, sponsor and
        participate in Expanding Your Horizons Conferences or other
        outreach and chapter activities, and have the opportunity to
        attend and make technical presentations at the annual meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members also receive an electronic copy of the current NMNWSE roster, which contains the contact information for all members to facillitate networking. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Professional membership in the New Mexico Network for Women in
        Science and Engineering is open to New Mexico women working (or
        interested) in a scientific or engineering environment. In December 2008 the Board
        voted to changed the membership rates for the first time in many years. The rate is
        now $40.00 per year for regular members, and the reduced rate for students, teachers, retired members, and non-employed members is $10.00.
