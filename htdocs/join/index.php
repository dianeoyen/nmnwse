        NMNWSE has hosted 25 annual technical symposiums, bringing together hundreds of women scientists. Members take a much-needed break, one weekend a year, to gather together in a welcoming, caring environment to re-energize, learn about other membersâ€™ work, and cultivate a network of encouragement and support. The NM Network strives to continue the 35-year legacy of active engagement by NM women in STEM who pay-it-forward as volunteers on the Board, during EYH Conferences, leading Committees, as judges during science fairs and competitions, and much more.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2007, the annual <a href="http://nmnwse.org/ImpactAward">IMPACT! Award</a> was established to recognize a NM woman for her extraordinary efforts in encouraging and helping women enter into and succeed in STEM field.
      </p>

      <p>
        NM Network members have helped provide gateway experiences in STEM to over 1,000 female-participants for 30 years, of which over 50% of the young women come from underrepresented minority groups. The Network has provided tote bags, seed funding, insurance, and promotional support for over 140 EYH Conferences in NM since 1980. Ultimately, this has reached over 20,000 girls and young women throughout the state for the past 37 years.
