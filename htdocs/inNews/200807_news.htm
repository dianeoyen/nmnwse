FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is an international program for children ages
9-14 (9-16 outside of the U.S. and Canada). It combines a hands-on, interactive robotics program and a research presentation with a sports-like atmosphere. Teams consist of up to 10 members and focus on such things as team building, problem solving, creativity, and analytical thinking.
<br> &nbsp;
</I></dd><dd><I>
Each September we provide FLL teams around the world with an annual Challenge. The Challenge is based on a set of real-world problems facing scientists today. It has two parts: a robot game and a project.
<br> &nbsp;
</I></dd><dd><I>
In the robot game teams design, build, program, and test autonomous robots that must perform a series of tasks, or missions. In the project, teams conduct research and create a technological or engineering solution to an aspect of the Challenge and present that solution.
