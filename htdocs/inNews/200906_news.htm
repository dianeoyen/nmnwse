The <a href="http://nmnwse.org/ImpactAward"><B>IMPACT! Award</b></a> is a great opportunity for a deserving woman to be recognized by her peers as well as the Commission on the Status of Women.  It is critical that we take the opportunity and make the effort to support each other by submitting nominations for this award.
