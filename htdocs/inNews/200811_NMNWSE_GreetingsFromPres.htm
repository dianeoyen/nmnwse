<!  Dear members of the NMNWSE, >

<P>
First, let me express how honored I am to serve as your President this 
year.  I am fortunate that this year I will be serving with an exceptional 
Executive Board: Laurie Marnell, VP-President Elect; Yolanda King, 
Treasurer; Claudia Barreto, Secretary; Elizabeth Kallmann, Past President.

<P>
The Annual Meeting in Truth or Consequences was fun, and I think we had a 
productive Board Meeting there as well.  My main priorities this year are to 
fundraise (I have volunteered to chair this subcommittee), increase 
visibility of the network, and to increase membership in NMNWSE.

<P>
Fortunately, the Network has an opportunity to be awarded funds from the New 
Mexico Career Technical and Workforce Education Bureau.  I met with Tony 
Korwin, Director (http://www.ped.state.nm.us/CTWEB/index.html)last week.  He 
asked me to compile an itemized list of things the Network needs funding 
for, and costs.  For example, we could ask for funds for school bus 
transport to EYH, materials for EYH, etc. We'll be working with Santa Fe 
Community College to access this Federal funding - there is $60,000 
available! Please submit your itemized lists to me by COB Monday the 
24th,and I'll submit the compiled list to Tony and the folks at SFCC.

<P>
Additionally, I encourage each of you to bring in at least one new member to 
the Network this year.  Many of our members have served for many years 
and "new blood" will make the Network stronger.  

<P>
Also, if you are interested in serving as Elections Chair or Treasurer, let 
me know.  Georgia Pedicini and Yolanda King have both worked long and 
successfully at these jobs and would be grateful to step back for a while.  
I am getting married Sept. 5, 2009, and will be taking a break from most of 
my volunteer service after that, so start thinking about perhaps serving as 
Vice President 2009-2010. 

<P>
Please do not hesitate to contact me at any time with your questions and/or 
concerns.  And everyone is welcome to attend our Board Meetings: the next 
one is at the offices of Peacock Myers, in Albuquerque, December 16, 10-12AM.

<P>
Thanks for all you do!<br>
Best Regards,<br>
Diane Albert<br>
2009 NMNWSE President
