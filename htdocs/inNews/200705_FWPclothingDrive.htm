The Federal Women's Program at the Albuquerque DOE site office is
sponsoring a clothing drive for women May 7 thru June 8, 2007. I copied the info from their
flyer below, and also linked a copy. If you have any questions about the program, please call
the listed contacts.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
If anyone in the Los Alamos or Santa Fe area wants to contribute, I am collecting northern chapter donations - please contact me to arrange pick-up before June 1, as I will be taking the northern chapter contributions down to Albuquerque the weekend of June 2.
