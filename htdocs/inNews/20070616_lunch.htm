NMNWSE members and friends are invited to join the
NMNWSE Board for lunch and informal networking in Santa Fe following the
June board meeting. There will be no set program, but we'd be very
interested in hearing from Santa Fe area members and potential members
as to how NMNWSE can better serve their needs. We hope to see you there! 
<br> <br>
Please RSVP so we can insure adequate seating is
reserved - feel free to RSVP with a "maybe" if you are not certain you
can attend, or come without RSVPing if you decide at the last minute. India palace has a lunch buffet that should accommodate a
wide variety of dietary preferences, but please include any dietary
restrictions in your RSVP so we can be sure your needs are accommodated.
India Palace validates parking in the lot next to their restaurant (off
Water St between Don Gaspar and Old Santa Fe Trail, 1 block south of the historic downtown plaza - tell the parking lot attendant you will be eating at India Palace). &nbsp;<a href="http://nmnwse.org/BoardMeetings/directions070616.htm">Click here for detailed directions.</a>
