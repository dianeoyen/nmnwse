EYH Conferences offer young women in middle and high school an opportunity to explore their career options through small hands-on technical career workshops led by female professionals from their local community. The conferences also include a component for accompanying adults. All attendees receive a 'Careers CD' featuring the NMNWSE publication <a href="http://nmnwse.org/careers">Careers: Exploring the Possibilities</a>.
