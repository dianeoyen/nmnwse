NMNWSE, in partnership with the NM Commission on the Status of Women, seeks nominations for the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/ImpactAward/"><B>2nd Annual IMPACT! Award</b></a>.
The award will recognize a New Mexico woman for her extraordinary efforts in encouraging women to enter into and develop their careers in science and engineering. 
<br><br>
"Last year was the first year for the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/ImpactAward/"><B>IMPACT! Award</b></a>. We are hoping for even more participation this year.
This Award seeks to recognize women from around the state who have been actively involved in educational outreach,
re-entry programs, networking and/or mentoring, and who have otherwise encouraged
or promoted equal participation by women in science and engineering will be nominated for our award,"
states Nancy Weinbrenner, Award Chair for the NMNWSE Board. 
<br><br>
Nominees do not need to be members of NMNWSE and, for the purposes of the award, science and engineering includes mathematics and all engineering fields as well as physical, biological, behavioral, medical and social sciences, and related technical and non-traditional fields. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
The honoree will be recognized during the Networks's <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2008">Annual Meeting and Technical Symposium</a>, which this year will be held 24-26 October 2008 at the Sierra Grande Lodge and Spa in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico.
