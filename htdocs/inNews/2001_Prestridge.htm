Publication Prize in Experimental Sciences</b> </font>

<P>
Kathy
Prestridge of Hydrodynamic Applications (DX-3) is the
winner of the 2000 Postdoctoral Publication Prize in Experimental
Sciences. The prize, jointly sponsored by Damon Giovanielli and
the Laboratory, is awarded every other year for the best article
in experimental sciences. 

<P>
Now a Laboratory staff member, Prestridge was recognized for her
paper "Validation of an instability growth model using particle
image velocimetry measurements," published in the May 8,
2000 issue of Physical Review Letters. This article is the first
high-speed fluid dynamics paper to include a detailed comparison
among a model, traditional (density-field) measurements, and
state-of-the-art velocity-field measurements.

<P>
Prestridge's paper represents a new generation of research
in an essential field of fluid dynamics<b>.</b> Prestridge received
her bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton
University and doctorate in engineering sciences from the University
of California at San Diego.
