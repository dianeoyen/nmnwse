members for 2006 Governor's Award</a></h3>
<ol>
  <li> Award the hard work or our members </li>
  <li> Encourage involvement in the Network from the nominated members </li>
  <li> Support the NM state woman's programs </li>
  <li> Help make the Network more visible in the state </li>
</ol>
If you would be interested in having NMNWSE nominate you (great!), or 
would like to recomment another NMNWSE member (please confirm they would be 
willint to be nominated), please let <a href="mailto:jtg@lanl.gov">Tinka Gammel</a>
know by Friday, January 6.

<P>
We have had more than one NMNSWE member win this award in a given year, 
but if we receive several nominee suggestions, we may use some of the nominee 
suggestions for a different award or in a future year, so NMNWSE nominees 
aren't "competing against each other".

<p>
Keep in mind, whomever is nominated will have to be willing to write a 
~500 word summary on their achievements. The NMNWSE board is willing to assist 
in this (see <a href="mailto:jtg@lanl.gov">jtg@lanl.gov</a>) In order for the 
Network to submit a packet by the deadline (NMNWSE will pay the application fee 
and may add additional supporting materials), we need to get achievement 
summary and supporting materials from the nominee by Thursday, February 16, 
2006.
