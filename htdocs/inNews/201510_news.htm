With<img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/spacer.gif" width=1 height=18> a special focus on Hispanic and Native American students, Laura brings them into research by finding a project for them near where they grew up. Brandi Cron Kamermans, one of the Native American students Laura mentored, states: "In the last eight years I have become a scientist, and it would not have been possible without Dr. Crossey's support", adding "I saw her do this for many students - each one taking a unique path in their education."
