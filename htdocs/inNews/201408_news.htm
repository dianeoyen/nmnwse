</h2>

After a bit of a hiatus, the NMNWSE Central Chapter held a meeting in April 2014 to reconnect and plan for the future.
At the April meeting, the chapter decided to hold meetings every month on the 3rd Wednesday, and meetings were held on 
May 21, Jul 16, Jun 18, and Aug 20.
Due to the success of the meetings, monthly meetings are scheduled for fall 2014.
- see the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/central">Central Chapter webpage for details</a>.

<P>
<!--
Occasional meetings will be held at other times to accomodate those who have a standing conflict.

Suggestions for speakers and other input for Central Chapter meeting planning are being solicited - please email your suggestions to the board or Central Chapter President, or use the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/central/contact_central.htm">"contact central" form</a>.
