The New Mexico Network for Women in Science in Engineering (NMNWSE), in partnership with the NM Commissions on the Status of Women, is proud to honor <b>Dr. Diane Elizabeth Albert</b> of Albuquerque with the <b>Sixth Annual IMPACT! Award</b>.
The award was presented at the January 2013 Central Chapter meeting as Diane was unable to attend the 2012 Annual Meeting.
<P>
Dr. Albert holds a Ph.D in Material Sciences and Engineering as well as a J.D. with a specialization in intellectual law.  Diane has been actively involved in promoting scholarships for Hispanic women pursing education and career goals in science through her participation with the non-profit organization MANA del Norte.  The president of MANA del Norte, Dolores Roybal describes Diane's efforts as playing "an important role in the success of our organization.  Through her active participation in fundraising efforts, her leadership and her tireless outreach efforts to increase participation of minority women in nontraditional fields.  She is not only a role model; she is a champion for the cause."
<P>
Diane's mentoring has also extended to introducing young women to STEM fields by leading fun and interactive technical workshops through the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/eyh">Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) program</a>.  
"Diane encouraged me to explore science and connect with others, and helped me make decisions about college and my field of study" describes Meghan McClelland, who was inspired to go into science by an EYH workshop Diane led, and who now volunteers at her local EYH.
