galvanizes kids' interest in robotics, works arduously to close the gender gap in STEM fields
through organizing and leading workshops in the northern NM Expanding Your Horizons (NNM
EYH), professionally mentors students and junior professionals in computer science and
engineering, and also finds time to network with and do STEM outreach to women and minority
small business start-ups in New Mexico.
