  The New Mexico Network for Women in Science and Engineering, in cooperation with
  the New Mexico Commission on the Status of Women, initiated the NMNWSE
  IMPACT! Award in 2007 to recognize the contributions of women in New Mexico.
</p>

<p>
  New Mexico is blessed to have Bonnie Frey as an active Science, Technology,
  Engineering, and Math citizen. She has contributed almost two decades to NM’s STEM
  capacity via research, teaching, training, leadership, and mentorship. Her STEM work is
  exceptional and impactful, particularly as a leader and mentor.
</p>

<p>
  Bonnie is deserving of this award for many reasons - her commitment to the future of
  STEM in New Mexico, her mentoring of women in STEM, being a great role model
  through her persistence and confidence to achieve her own STEM degree and her
  career pathway in a male dominated field, and for increasing the participation and
  retention of women students in STEM – helping them build their own personal sense of
  belonging in the STEM culture.
