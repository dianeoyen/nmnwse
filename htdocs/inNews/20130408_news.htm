</h2>
<P>
The 2013 New Mexico YWCA Women on The Move Awards were announced on April 3, and include two NMNWSE members: <b>Rebecca Galves</b> and <b>Irene Lee</b>. Both Rebecca and Irene have chaired NMNWSE EYH conferences, and are well deserving of this recognition.
<P>
Quoting the Apr 7 Albuquerque Journal article:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rebecca Galves coordinates Young Women in Computing, a program at New Mexico State University, where she mentors the next generation of computer scientists, many who are young women from cultural and social groups underrepresented in computer science. Through her work with middle and high school students, all have gone on to college, and 62 percent have majored in computer science."
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irene Lee has mentored scores of young women in computing and technology throughout the state and works with several committees and organizations to enhance this work. In 2012, a national award recognized her efforts in educating minorities and women."
