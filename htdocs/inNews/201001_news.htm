<P>
Joan said the Award couldn't have come at a better time.
<!  It will be used to help kick off a new outreach effort at Sandia.  >
It will be leveraged to help energize and
highlight awards for deserving women at SNL - "there is a need for women to do a better job of helping and recognizing other women, and the IMPACT! Award is a good example for that process". 


<P>
The IMPACT! award is given by NMNWSE in cooperation with the NM Commission on the Status of Women to recognize New Mexico women for their extraordinary efforts in encouraging and helping women enter and succeed in science, technology, engineering and math as well as promoting
networking and communication among women in these careers.
