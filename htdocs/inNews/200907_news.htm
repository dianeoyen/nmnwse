<P>
Oct 16-17, 2009, will mark the NM Commission on the Status of Women's 4th Annual Believe in NM Girls SLAM Conference (Sensational Leaders, Amazing Me). The Commission is looking for qualified and energetic workshop presenters. The conference will be held at the UNM Student Union Building in Albuquerque.

<P>
The Commission started the girl's program in 2005, which quickly blossomed into the NM Girls Institute (NMGI) - a proactive direct service to girls that provides girls with a safe and supportive environment to learn about issues and develop skills that will allow them to become successful NM women.

<P>
The Institute spoke with several teenage girls to discuss potential topics for workshops, and they proposed a list focusing on issues related to self-esteem and leadership skills, which can be found on the Call for Presenters.
<br>
(For NMNWSE members' convenience, the Call for workshop presenters and Call for Exhibitors have been posted at:

<br>
Note the Commission has extended the deadline for our group for presenters to Aug 8, 2009 - contact Kathi if interested.)

<P>
Workshops should be interactive and hands-on, whenever possible. Workshops will be approximately an hour in length and focused on educating and inspiring participants in the areas of self-esteem enhancement and leadership. The girls participating will be from different communities, cultures, and experiences.

<P>
We hope you will take this opportunity to partner with the NM Commission on the Status of Women's Girls Institute and become a presenter. If you have any questions regarding the Institute or the conference, please contact Kathi (contact info below).

<P>
Thank you for your support and interest,
