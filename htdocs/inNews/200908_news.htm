<P>
Open positions for the 2010 Board (serves Oct 2009 through Oct 2010) include Vice-President/President-Elect and Secretary, plus several At-Large positions. Please consider nominating someone to serve on the executive committee, including yourself. We really need a good slate of Members-at-Large since there were only two elected last year.

<P>
Descriptions of board positions and duties can be found in our <a href="http://nmnwse.org/pnp.html">Policies and Procedures</a>. To nominate someone simply email the <a href="mailto:NMNWSE_Board-l@list.unm.edu">NMNWSE Board</a> with your suggestion. Please also feel free to <a href="mailto:NMNWSE_Board-l@list.unm.edu">contact the Board</a> if you have any questions (on this or any other issue).
