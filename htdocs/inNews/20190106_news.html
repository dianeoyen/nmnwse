  As NMNWSE members, we have lead projects in research, development, networking opportunities, and expansion of STEM education, outreach, and services. We have held information tables at conferences, hosted workshops, led STEM discussions, coordinated conferences, published papers, and directed teams in regional and national industries. And we continue to serve as primary caretakers for family members, running households, and maintaining order in the midst of potential calamity.

  Thank you for all you do! What an honor it is to be a part of this professional group.
