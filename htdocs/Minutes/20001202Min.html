<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">Board Meeting<br>December 2, 2000</h2>

<P>The meeting was held at Kim Linder&#146;s house in Cedar Crest. Board members in attendance were: J. Margo Clark, Claudia Lewis, Carol LaDelfe, Karen Saenz, Wyona Turner, Angelique Neuman, Mary Campbell, Mary Lou Westrom, Dana Roberson, Tinka Gammel, Kim Linder, and Sara Gottlieb.</P>

<P>The meeting was called to order by Margo Clark at 10:05 a.m. Minutes were reviewed, and a correction to Elections was the following: <I>Due to an error on the ballot, Claudia Lewis was on the ballot as President-elect. She had declined this position before the election because she will be out of the country this year. Angelique Neuman had accepted the nomination for this position before the election, but the ballot went out without showing this change.</I> Mary Lou Westrom also felt that she had not been consulted before her name was placed on the ballot. Discussion continued on how to ensure that the ballot was correct before it was sent out. Mary Campbell suggested a short Bio for each candidate would help us know more about the candidates and ensure that they knew they were on the ballot. Claudia will be doing elections next year, and she agreed that a more accurate ballot would be done and more interest needed to be generated to get a better return of the ballots. She will incorporate these suggestions. Wyona made a motion to approve the minutes with this correction (above in italics). Carol seconded it, and it was approved.</P>

<h3>TREASURER&#146;S REPORT   -- Claudia Lewis and Tinka Gammel</h3>
<P>Claudia presented the Treasurer&#146;s report and will hand the books over to Tinka. Major activity this month was deposit of check from FEMA for $5683.59 for the career booklets destroyed in the Cerro Grande fire. Claudia had the nonprofit corporate report for the officers to sign, which is filed every year for the IRS. She received two tax-exempt magnetic cards from Office Depot and gave one to Wyona and one to Tinka.  Claudia received a donation from Honeywell for $1000 for EYH for Central and Northern conferences. She received $865 for 22 professional memberships and a few students and retired memberships. Angelique moved to accept the Treasurer&#146;s report, Carol seconded it, and it was passed.</P>
<h3>STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Annual Meeting &#151; Karen Saenz</P>
<dd>The meeting was held at Ruidoso October 20-22, 2000. Nineteen people attended and seven interesting papers were presented.  The group enjoyed dinner at the Casa Blanca and entertainment by John and Jonni.  The Chapter broke even financially. Report filed in Archive notebook.</P>
<dt>Archives &#151; Mary S. Campbell</P>
<dd>Mary talked to dede Collins, and dede will bring the boxes of the Archives to her. Mary printed the Bylaws and Policies and Procedures from the Web site and thanked Carol for updating the web site. Karen wrote that she was locating the current Bylaws and Procedures to put on the Web site.</dd>

<dt>Elections &#151; Claudia Lewis</dt>
<dd>Claudia promised a good slate of officers and hoped to find more candidates than one for each office to engender interest in the election. Also, she will ask for short bios and provide better ballots. If possible we will investigate web-based elections. In the last election, write-in candidates including Tinka, Ann, and Dana have joined the board in active roles.</dd>

<dt>Fund Raising &#151; Mary Lou Westrom</dt>
<dd>Mary Lou asked the officers for bios for use in fund raising. Her address is P.O. Box 1007, Cedar Crest, NM 87008. She also has a FAX 242-7355. She will find out if she can have an e-mail address on her office computer. When she gets an e-mail address, it will be reported to the group. Information needed for the Honeywell grant included bios, audit report on the Treasury and budget for the year, but the deadline passed because of problems communicating with each officer. Dana said she would get a grant application from the RGK Foundations. Donation checks are sent to the P.O. Box and Judith Mead picks up the mail and sends it to the Treasurer or other officer indicated. We will check our lines of communication for efficiency.</dd>

<dt>Membership &#151; Wyona Turner</dt>
<dd>Wyona reported about 40 renewals; however, more were coming into the P.O. Box.</dd>

<dt>Newsletter &#151; Angelique Neuman and Sara Gottlieb</dt>
<dd>Angelique agreed to continue as newsletter editor for the November newsletter, which was now planned for December. It was not sent out in November to include the survey for the June workshop. Sara agreed to cochair. The newsletter will come out about every other month to present the board meeting summary. Angelique also reported two honorary memberships were approved for Nanette Founds and Anita Reiser from the Central Chapter. She wanted to encourage more members to get the e-mail version. Only a few get the hard copy version now.</dd>

<dt>Policies and Procedures &#151; Sara Gottlieb</dt>
<dd>There was no change in Policies and Procedures this time. Carol made a motion to abolish the Policies and Procedures chair until we need it. Mary Lou seconded and the motion passed.</dd>

<dt>Publicity &#151; Kim Linder</dt>
<dd>Kim and Brenda Davies are designing a brown wrapper that will go into the Albuquerque Journal with information about the Central Chapter EYH and the organization. Brenda will do the graphic art. Brenda has recently redesigned the logo and it was passed around the group and approved to be our official logo. The brown wrapper will have information on the purpose of the group, the web site, the annual meeting, professional development seminar, sponsors, and donors. Kim did not know when it would be in the paper because paid advertisement wrappers have precedence over our free one. Free publicity from KUNM and KNME needs a 3-month lead-time. Publicity for the professional development seminar needs to be decided by early March to send out to the radio stations and professional journals. Brenda will send the new logo to Carol to put on the web and for letterhead for stationery that can be downloaded from the web. Carol will prepare the letterhead. [Think about how to made the down load of the stationery only available to someone with a password, (MSC)]</dd>

<dt>Science Fair &#151; Mercedes Agogino and Dana Roberson</dt>
<dd>Dana needs help in organizing the science fair judges. Mercedes will get the information from the State Science Fair, and Claudia will help get the judges. It is sometimes difficult to communicate with Mercedes. Margo will continue attempting to talk to her. Two certificates were passed around that had been designed for the Los Alamos Science fair by Jody Shepard. The one that the Northern Chapter did not pick could be used for the State Science Fair. A committee was formed that includes Dana, Claudia, and Angelique to decide on the criteria for the science fair awards. A discussion followed about mixed gender teams. In the case of a team, the young women on the team must be strong presenters. </P>
<dd>Karen moved that the 1<SUP>st</SUP> prize wold be $50 to 5 categories in Jr. and Sr. divisions. The subjects of the categories will be selected by the expertise of the judges present. The 2<SUP>nd</SUP> place prize will be a new-logo canvas bag with a career booklet. Cards of excellence will be presented to any contestant the judges feel have an excellent entry. A mixed gender team could win if the girl is a strong presenter. If a team wins first prize, each member will get the same prize. A male team can win if the purpose of their project is to promote gender equity. Claudia seconded the motion. The motion was amended by Tinka to give the first place winners a canvas bag and career booklet, also. Carol seconded the motion. On voting, the amendment was passed, and then the motion was passed.</dd>

<dd>The group then discussed the Professional Development Seminar Survey. It was decided that it was more time critical and only it would go out with the December newsletter with request for return by December 22. A magnet with the new logo printed by an ink jet printer would be given to the respondents. A committee of Karen, Wyona, Anglique, Claudia, Mary Lou, and Ann Lee would meet Jan. 20 in Cedar Crest at Dana Roberson&#146;s home from 10 to 12 am.

<h3>NEW BUSINESS</h3>
<div class="back"><ul type="disc">
<li>Honorary membership for Brenda Davies and Linda McCormick was suggested for the Central Chapter to act upon.</dd>
<li>A Web Communications chair was suggested by Carol to keep the web up to date.<br>
That would require a change in the policy and procedure, which chair we abolished earlier in the meeting. Carol will write up the procedure for this chair and it will be decided next meeting.</dd>
<li>Can a chapter be one person? This is a question because of the low number of participants in some parts of this state.</P>
<li>Claudia will see that the bags with the new logo are ordered for the science fair. The bags will also be given to the first 25 that reply to the membership survey.</dd>
</ul></div>
