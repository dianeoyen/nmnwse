<B><LI>Annual Meeting &#151;  Kelly Bitner (proxy)</LI></B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The annual meeting is scheduled for October 19-21 in Albuquerque at the Sheraton Uptown.  Margo read Kelly&#146;s report.  For the Professional Seminar, Kelly is in contact with Susan Gapton for a workshop on leadership and management skills, scheduled (tentatively) for the morning.  Kelly is looking into an afternoon workshop on networking skills.  Possible keynote speakers are Betty Chow (?sp) or Bess Sellers who is a DOE manager at the Kansas City Plant.  Dinner is scheduled to be at the aquarium in front of the shark tank at $30/person (not covered in registration fee) for 30 people.  For publicity, Kelly needs contacts for other newsletters (e.g., Sandia and LANL).  Kelly roughly estimated the cost to both the Professional Development Seminar and Annual Conference to be about $100 per person.  Budget and costs were based on the $250 budgeted for the annual meeting and planning on registration for 30 people.  Since the Board had allocated $1500 for the Professional Seminar, a motion was made and passed to reallocate those monies toward the annual meeting (with Professional Seminar), especially to help cover cost for publicity and speaker fees and to help reduce the cost to membership.  Based on this, the Board asked Margo to let Kelly know of the additional money and rework her budget.  Also suggested was to charge student&#146;s _ the cost of registration.  The Board also requested clarification of the dinner &#133; is it Friday evening or Saturday evening?  If it is Saturday, she might look into setting up a Friday evening dinner in a more casual setting with possibly a speaker.  Agencies or businesses will tend to cover the cost of the meal if a speaker is scheduled.  Many suggestions were mentioned for publicity contacts.  Included were:  state web server; LAWIS server; LANL&#146;s Women&#146;s Diversity Working Group; UNM (Lobo, women scientists/profs); AAUW (contact:  Adrienne Dare is on the state board) with deadline of August 10 for their newsletter; SWE (contact: Anita Riser at Sandia); tents at LANL cafeteria, Hispano Chamber of Commerce (contact is Mary Ann Jones 842-9003); NMCSW (contact: Yolanda Roybal 841-8920); State Dept. of Ed.;UNM-LA (contact Rebecca Laff); Bradbury Science Museum in Los Alamos (contact Pat Rogers); LANL graduate and post-doc students (contact Carol Rutten); ad  in Albuq. Journal or Tribune (there is money in our budget available for advertising); and SAGE in Journal.  A question was asked if the call for papers had been placed yet.  Margo will check the status on this and on the (tentative) agenda with Kelly.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brenda Davies is working on publicity brochure.  Kim will put in request for newspaper brown wrapper ad to include EYH contacts for Northern (Dana), Silver City (Adrienne) and Central (Kelly).</P>

The deadline is September 17, does anyone wish to nominate a member?  The Board agreed on nominating Janie Enter.  It was also suggested to have another organization nominate this same person.  Suggested was the Women Diversity Working Group (contact Georgia Pedicini at <A HREF="mailto:gap@lanl.gov">gap@lanl.gov</A>).  Other awards include YWCA &quot;Women on the Move&quot; Award.</P>
