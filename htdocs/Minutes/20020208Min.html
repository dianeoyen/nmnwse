<h4 ALIGN="CENTER">Board Meeting</h4>
<h4 ALIGN="CENTER">2 February 2002</h4>

<p><i>Corrections amended and approved during 1 June 2002 BOD Meeting.</i></p>

<p>The meeting was held at Kelly Bitner's house in Albuquerque. Board members in attendance were:  Jeanne, Tinka, dede, Kelly, Margo, Kim, Alexine, Carol, Barbara, Yolanda, Dana, Beulah, and Mary.</p>

<h4>Jeanne called the meeting to order at 10:10 am.</h4>

<h3>SECRETARY'S REPORT - Alexine Salazar</h3>
<p>The minutes for the 1 December 2001 meeting were distributed and read by members present.  Motion to accept the minutes as written was made by Yolanda, seconded by Kim; motion was passed.<br>

Alexine submitted a reimbursement request (on file) to cover mailings for $10.73.</p>

<h3>TREASURER'S REPORT - Yolanda Jones King</h3>

<p>Yolanda reported she is still missing some bank statements.  Tinka mentioned she has several, which she will forward to Yolanda.  A balance of $509.57 is probably incorrect; a balance of $2,200.00 is the balance received when requested from the bank.  This is without Adrienne's checks.  Yolanda will be checking with the bank regarding those checks.</p>

<p>Yolanda reported she is sending a letter to Dwayne Sowenson to change signatures on the money market account.  Kelly has the address and information and will mail to Yolanda.</p>

<p>Regarding Career Booklets, $700+ is owed Tinka.  The question of "Where is the master copy?" came up.  Ann Mauzy has it on ZIP and Tinka has it on CD.  .  A check for $43.09 was paid to Alpha Graphics for writing the CD.  After all EYH conferences, we will have about 400 Career Booklets left.</p>

<p>Alexine has been sending membership checks with copy of form to Yolanda and the original form forwarded on to Carol.  Alexine should also write the check number on Carols form.</p>

<p>A motion to accept the Treasurer's report was made by dede, seconded by Kelly, and passed.</p>
