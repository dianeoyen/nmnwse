<h4>The meeting was held in Los Alamos at Carol LaDelfe's home. Board members in attendance were:  Carol, Yolanda, Tinka, and Alexine.</h4>

<p>NOTE:  Margo gave us her proxy vote prior to the meeting;  the five votes gave us a simple majority which allowed us to motion and approved items.</p>

<h4>In the absence of Jeanne, Carol called the meeting to order at 10:40am.</h4>

<h3>SECRETARY'S REPORT - Alexine Salazar</h3>

<dl><dd>Minutes for the February 2 BOD meeting were amended as follows:  Tinka corrected the amount owed her to $700+ from $3700+;  AlphaGraphics doesn't owe us a CD; we don't owe AlphaGraphics any money; and the $43.09 paid to AlphaGraphics was for them to save it to CD (although they did not convert to HTML as they were supposed to).</dd>

<dd>Motion to accept the minutes as amended was made by Yolanda, seconded by Carol; motion was passed.</dd>

<dd>Alexine picked up the mail a few days prior to this meeting.  She gave Yolanda a statement for the PO box (fee due).  She also gave Carol returned membership mailings to update her membership database.</dd>

<dd>Alexine submitted a reimbursement for postage totaling $4.23.</dd></dl>

<h3>TREASURER'S REPORT - Yolanda Jones King</h3>

<dl><dd>Yolanda provided two reports, one for the April meeting, which was cancelled.  The second for this meeting.  At the end of May, our checking balance was $4,255.05 and money market was $7,011.77.  Only $30 was received for dues and $500 was paid out for Science Fair winners.  Ending balance is $3,755.05 for checking; money market remained the same.</dd>

<dd>A motion to accept the Treasurer's report was made by Alexine, seconded by Yolanda; motion was passed.</dd>

<dd>A $10 fee to cover the nomination of Kelly Bitner for the New Mexico Commission on the Status of Women Estrella Award: Celebrating the Shining Stars of New Mexico was discussed.

<h3>EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS</h3>

<ol><li><b>State EYH - Adrienne Dare (proxy)</b><br>
This year there were three EYH conferences in New Mexico:  Silver City on March 2, contact person was Adrienne Dare, Albuquerque on March 9, contact person was Linda McCormick, and Los Alamos on March 13, contact person was Dana Roberson.<br>

EYH evaluations for the Silver City and Albuquerque conferences have been sent to the Math/Science network.  Adrienne was not sure if Los Alamos sent in their report.<br>

<li><b>Northern Chapter (Los Alamos) - Dana Roberson (proxy)</b><br>
Dana provided a written report (on file).</li>

<li><b>Central Chapter (Albuquerque) - Kim Linder (proxy)</b><br>
(NOTE:  Proxy report submitted for April 13 BOD meeting which was canceled).<br>

The EYH in Albuquerque was held March 9 at UNM.  The keynote speaker was Dr. Kathy Haaland, a neurologist.  There were about 26 workshops for the expected 400 girls.  There was also an adult program, which featured financial aide, how to keep your daughter interested in math and science, and a tour of some UNM labs.</li>

<li><b>Southern Chapter (Silver City) - Adrienne Dare (proxy)</b><br>
The Silver City EYH conference at WNMU was held on March 2, 2002.  There were 16 role models for our workshops.  We had approximately 175 girls attend.  This is the largest number ever.  Around 240 had registered.  Since our brochures were out very late, these registrations were gathered in just one week before the conference.<br>

At registration in the morning at 9:00 the girls picked up their packets and picked out a t-shirt.  Throughout the day there were drawings for prizes.  After gathering for registration, the girls then attended two workshops, one before lunch and one after lunch.  The Biology Club cooked and served a hot dog lunch for the girls and the helpers.  After the third workshop, the girls participated in a group activity in the gym.  After the group activity we had the final drawing for more prizes followed by the girls filling out their evaluations.  The conference ended at 3:00 pm.<br>

We felt the conference was a great success in spite of the fact that a lot of the work got done at the last minute due to family emergencies in the lives of a couple of the organizers.  Since our local fundraising was late in getting going, we raised a lot less than anticipated but with the excess from previous years it looks like we'll break even this year.  The total in the account was about $1600 and the expenses are about $1600.</li></ol>
