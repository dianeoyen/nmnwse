No report.  However, Kathy Prestridge has requested the Board discuss her request to modify the membership form (or just have it for the Northern Chapter).

<h3>EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS</h3>

<ol><li><b>Dana submitted an article to the Math & Science Network.</b><br>

Tinka mentioned she has 100-400 Career Booklets available.  There is a PageMaker version on CD as well as a PDF and HTML version on the web.  Jeanne will check with Cottonwood (TRW's contract for printing) to get an estimate on printing copies.  Also, she can check on getting paper from someone else which would be ~20% less than buying from Cottonwood.  Tinka will send 2 booklets (and a bag) to Jeanne to show the printer.<br>

We only have about 20 bags so those need to be ordered.</li>
