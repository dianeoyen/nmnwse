<dd>Kelly presented the 2001 Annual meeting Budget for approval. The meeting is planned for October 19-21 at the Uptown Sheraton at Menaul and Lousiana. She separated the costs for the annual meeting from that of the Workshop to be held on Friday.

If 30 people come the annual meeting, $70 is proposed charge with $20 for extra dinner guests. Charge for workshop is $30. She suggested that the Board Meeting on Sunday be held at her home instead of at the hotel. The Board was happy with the proposed arrangements and approved the budget.
