<dd>No other Southern EYH this year</dd></dl>

<h3>Chapter Reports:</h3><dl><dt><b>Northern Chapter</b> &mdash; Cathy Cleland, President.</dt>
<dd>This quarter has been a busy one for us. We have already judged and passed out awards at two science fairs and are planning to do so for at least 3 more before spring is here! We received many thank you notes from the schools and the awardees stating that the awards (cash and award certificate) have encouraged them even more to do well in science (see this month&#146;s Newsletter).</dd>
<dd>The EYH season is in full swing! The Northern chapter EYH is March 28 and Dana Roberson has gotten most of it ready to go! We have received funding from internal sources and are preparing to talk with external donors. Tinka Gammel has found a wonderful idea for one of the giveaways: magnets with the NMNWSE and LAWIS logos. </dd>
<dd>Our LunchTime talk series is going strong this year . Joanne Wendelberger&#146;s talk on evaluating factors affecting student performance was well attended and well received. It was quite informative. Upcoming talks include two on Career Development and one on balancing career and home life. If you haven&#146;t been to any this year, I encourage you to attend!</dd>
<dd>We have set up a networking listserv address and the beginning of a website. The networking site will serve as a tool for women to consult women concerning careers and anything else pertaining to networking. The listserv address is: <A HREF="mailto:lawis_nw@lanl.gov">lawis_nw@lanl.gov</A>. Anyone is welcome to send email through the listserv. The website contains sites for job search engines and information on preparing resumes. Please make suggestions on content or design to Cathy Cleland, <A HREF="mailto:buzzer@lanl.gov">buzzer@lanl.gov</A>. The current URL: <A HREF="http://www.t12.lanl.gov/home/lawis/NETWORKING/index.html">http://www.t12.lanl.gov/home/lawis/NETWORKING/index.html</A>.</dd>
<dd>So far this year we have 45 members that have renewed and 5 new members. Lori Merrill has sent reminders to 2 past members. We think getting more involved with the women at LANL through networking and other membership functions will bring attention to LAWIS and NMNWSE as a positive and supportive group in which to belong.</dd>
<dd>We are looking forward as well to the State sponsored career day in June 2001! ;</dd>
<dt><b>Central Chapter</b> &mdash; Kelly Bitner has the checkbook. She will have a meeting to decide what form of meeting would attract the Albuquerque group to a meeting.</dt>

<dt><b>Southern Chapter</b></dt>
<dd>Karen Saenz will head the professional seminar in late June.</dd>
