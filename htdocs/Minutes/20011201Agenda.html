As you all know, our NMNWSE Board meeting will be held at 10 am at Jeanne Banks' home in Rio Rancho. Directions will follow.  Please let me know if you would like to add something to the draft agenda below.
<br>
This is a very important meeting to attend.  We will be discussing new directions for our organization, which will probably consist of modifying our mission and charter.  <br><b>Jeanne Banks will be assuming presidency during this meeting.</b>
<br>
Note that the listing below of chairs of our standing committees reflects their positions during this last fiscal year, not the current one.  The reason for this is that I asked at our Board meeting on Oct. 21 that the current chairs continue in their current positions through this December meeting, at which time Jeanne can appoint new chairs.   All Board members in attendence at the October Board meeting agreed to this temporary arrangement.
<br>
Since this meeting is in the Albuquerque area, I don't have any suggestions for an activity to follow the meeting. Perhaps we could go to one of the museums unless someone has a better idea.  Perhaps the attendees from Albuquerque can help with suggestions regarding a fun activity.
<br>
PLEASE let me know whether you plan to attend!  I hope to see you there!<br>
Margo<br>
Acting President, NMNWSE</p>
