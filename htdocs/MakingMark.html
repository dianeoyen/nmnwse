<h2>Women making the mark</h2> </font>

<p>Technology has a shortage of women, yet a number are making
a mark in the field. Among them: </p>

<h3>Carol Bartz, chief executive officer, Autodesk</b></h2>

<p>Bartz, 47, has been known to quote The Lion King in interviews.
That's probably thanks to having a young daughter. She's funny and personable.
And she runs the fourth-largest software company in the world. </p>

<p>Bartz was a computer science major at the University of
Wisconsin. She worked at Digital Equipment and 3M, but her career took
off when she joined Sun Microsystems in 1983. Over the next 9 years, she
worked her way up Sun's ladder and in 1992, was named CEO of Autodesk.

<h3>Debra Chrapaty, chief information officer, National
Basketball Association</h3>

<p>Chrapaty, 35, is a woman in a job dominated by men inside
a macho sports organization. Her 30-person department is in charge of the
NBA's computer system. That means all the computers in NBA offices and
more: NBA games are &quot;content&quot; - programming that can be played
on TVs, VCRs or PCs. Increasingly, content is stored in computers instead
of on videotape.</p>

<p>Chrapaty knows few women are in jobs like hers but says
they can make it if they have traits including &quot;commitment, diligence,
intelligence . . . and an ability to take a joke.&quot;</p>

<h3>Sadie Decker, senior vice president, Tele-Communications
Inc.</h3>

<p>Decker doesn't hesitate to say she's a woman who has gotten
used to playing by men's rules. Decker, who won't give her age, thrived
at &quot;totally male-dominated&quot; Martin Marietta and eventually began
running the company's computer department.</p>

<p>But when the company moved her operation to Maryland,
Decker, who is married and has two children, didn't want to go. She heard
cable giant TCI was looking for someone to overhaul the company's technology.
She got the job and has been key in TCI's push into interactive TV and
the Internet.</p>

<h3>Judith Hamilton, CEO, First Floor Software</h3>

<p>Hamilton was named CEO of First Floor in March. She was
lured away from technology market research firm Dataquest, where she was
CEO.</p>

<p>Hamilton, 51, started her career as a programmer, then
took detours into marketing. First Floor, which has 30 employees, makes
software called Smart Bookmarks. It monitors selected Internet sites and
notifies the user when it spies something new.</p>

<h3>Heidi Roizen, vice president, developer relations, Apple
Computer</h3>

<p>In a year when Apple Computer watched many of its best
people leave, it managed to lure in Roizen, one of the most successful
female entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. </p>

<p>Roizen, 39, is not a trained engineer. In college, she
majored in creative writing. Then she got an MBA from Stanford University.
At 24, she started T/Maker, which made software for Macintosh computers.
The company took off, and Roizen became one of those technology millionaires.
</p>

<p>At Apple, Roizen, who has two children, is in charge of
building and maintaining relationships between Apple and its software developers.
</p>

<h3>Ann Winblad, partner, Hummer Winblad Venture Partners
</h3>

<p>Winblad has always been comfortable surrounded by men,
which came in handy as she pursued a math-oriented course of study. </p>

<p>&quot;In math class, it was me and the guys. In business
class, it was me and the guys. In the computer center, it was me and the
guys,&quot; she says. &quot;It prepared me for an industry that started
out as me and the guys.&quot; In 1976, she put up $500 and co-founded Open
Systems, which made accounting software. In 1983, she sold the company
for $15 million. After working as a consultant, Winblad co-founded Hummer
Winblad in 1989.</p>

<p>The firm invests in other computer-industry start-ups.
</p>

<p>&quot;There is nothing that prohibits women from running
a company,&quot; she says. </p>
