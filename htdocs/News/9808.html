<P><FONT SIZE="+1">When the smell of roasting green chile is in the
air, it should remind us all of one thing - it&#146;s time to
participate in the <B>Annual Meeting </B>of the New Mexico Network
for Women in Science and Engineering. It will be held on October
23-25 at the Sevilleta Long-Term Ecological Research Site, which is
between Albuquerque and Soccoro. The theme is "Preparing for the Turn
of the Millenium" and we have some interesting presentations to look
forward to including a Year 2000 keynote address, Hantavirus
research, and a team-building through martial arts session. However,
there is still room on the agenda for presentations, so get yours in
to Debby Potter (ulinski@sevilleta.unm.edu).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">At the 1997 Annual Meeting there was a suggestion
that Network funds be put to good use, specifically in the form of
scholarships. A subcommittee developed a scholarship proposal that
has been reviewed by the Board. At the Annual Meeting in October, the
Board will make a recommendation not to start a scholarship program.
The reasons for this are:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Money</I></B>: As shown on the
   Treasurer&#146;s Report, the Network has two "pots" of money. One
   is the operating money, which comes from dues and fund-raising.
   The fundraising is specifically for EYH, and can not be used for
   other purposes, even scholarships. The portion that comes from
   dues doesn&#146;t quite cover the non-EYH expenditures for the
   year. The other pot of money is the money market, which is not
   being added to, and therefore represents only a finite source of
   potential scholarship money. The interest on the money market
   account is about $300 per year, which is used to cover expenses
   that the operating funds don&#146;t quite cover.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Duration: </I></B>If the money market
   funds were used (about $6500), the duration of the scholarship
   program would be very limited or the awards would be so small that
   they would not serve as encouragement to the recipient.</FONT>
   
   <LI><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Administration:</I></B> The
   administration of a scholarship program (forming a committee,
   reading applications, selecting applicants, awarding the
   money&#133;.) was viewed as prohibitive, considering the overall
   decrease in participation of the membership.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The scholarship program suggestion was motivated
by the perception that the Network at the State level is sitting on
lots of money that should be used. While the Board is open to
discussing options, we recommend that the scholarship program not be
adopted by the network. One option that was discussed at the August
Board meeting was the possibility of increasing the amount or number
of awards given at the State Science Fair by the Network.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Speaking of fundraising, the drawing for the
raffle will be held at the Annual Meeting. <B> Please make extra
effort to sell raffle tickets!!!</B></FONT></P>

<P><B>See you at Sevilleta in October.</B></P>

<center><h2>1998 Annual Meeting and Technical Symposium</h2></center>

<center><P>by Debby Potter<br>Annual Meeting Program Chair</P></center>

<P><B>Now is the perfect time to register</B> for the
annual meeting and technical symposium and to submit an abstract for
your oral presentation! The theme is Preparing for the Turn of the
Millenium and Jeannie Banks will provide the keynote address on Y2K
computer problems, myths and realities. Just like three years ago it
will be held at a University of New Mexico research facility, the
Sevilleta Long-Term Ecological Research site north of Socorro (I-25
exit 169). You can have a virtual visit to the Sevilleta LTER, at
<A HREF="http://sevilleta.unm.edu/">http://sevilleta.unm.edu/</A>,
one of the U.S. National Science Foundation LTER Network sites.
<B>Limited housing is available there for $5 per
night.</B></P>

<P>The meeting dates are <B>October 23-35, 1998</B>.
We will begin with registration at 3:00-3:30 p.m. on Friday October
23. There will be sessions for presentation of papers following
registration and on Saturday, plus the State Board meeting
tentatively planned for Sunday morning. After the board meeting we
may have an optional visit to the <B>National Radio Astronomy
Observatory Very Large Array</B> which is located on the Plains of
San Augustin 50 miles west of Socorro. Saturday evening dinner will
be at the Val Verde Restaurant in Socorro. There we'll have a
<B>special performance of Susan B. Anthony by Marilyn Adams</B>,
Chautauqua Scholar (partially funded by the New Mexico Endowment for
the Humanities). Peg Strain has been invited to do a <B>team-building
session based on martial arts</B>, so bring some loose-fitting
clothes. Beulah Woodfin is making food arrangements similar to the
previous meeting, so you can eat all other meals right at the
LTER.</P>

<P>A registration fee of $50 covers meals (except
Saturday dinner) and conference materials. Four students have
requested scholarships. The Network can award a total of eight
scholarships based on financial need if the potential recipient
submits an abstract and presents the material. For program
information and to transmit abstracts (by September 15) you can reach
Debby by email -- <B>ulinski@sevilleta.unm.edu</B>. For other
inquiries contact Rosalie Graves, Annual Meeting and Technical
Symposium Chair, at 246-8600 (w) or 299-2039 (h).</P>

<P>There will be plenty of chances to visit with one
another at this exciting, but casual meeting. <B>See you
there!</B></P>

and listserver she has set up for the Northern Chapter.</P>

<P>The minutes from the June meeting were reviewed
and approved. The Treasurer had no report. The meeting adjourned at
12:00 p.m.</P>

<h3>STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS</h3>

be put together at the end of August. Jennifer will put together the
newsletter and send the document to Carol to copy and distribute.
Kelly will send Jennifer the President&#146;s message at the end of
August.</P>

<h4>State Science Fair</h4>

<P>Kelly reported for Mercedes that we have received
four thank you notes from young women who we gave rewards to at the
State Science Fair.</P>

<h4>Policies &amp; Procedures</h4>

<P>No report.</P>

<h4>Publicity</h4>

<P>Jennifer gave her Publicity binder to Kelly to
pass on at the next Board meeting.</P>

<h4>EYH</h4>

<P>No report.</P>

<h4>EYH Reports</h4>

<P><B>CENTRAL. </B>Deborah Potter reported that Nan
Founds is the chair and so far they have been actively recruiting for
students, including contacting the area Girl Scouts. Training for
presenters has been arranged.</P>

<P><B>NORTHERN</B>. Margo Clark reported that adult
workshops for teachers are being discussed.</P>

<P><B>SILVER CITY.</B> No report.</P>

<P><B>LAS CRUCES.</B> Submitted by Karen Saenz. Our
EYH conference was on April 23, 1998. We had over 250</P>

<P>Students and adults participating. We lost money
this year: total income $2019.00, total expenses of $2299.33, NET
-$280.33. Mostly this was because of printing costs we incurred this
year. One of the highlights this year was using high school students
as ambassadors and role models. The younger girls responded
favorably. We plan to use high school girls again next year and the
Military Academy has already volunteered. On the downside, we are
still trying to get paid. The schools are very slow at paying for
Purchase Orders even after receiving an invoice. Next year, we&#146;l
add payment requirements and instructions to the registration
information to ensure we are paid on time.</P>

<h3>CHAPTER REPORTS</h3>

<h4>CENTRAL</h4> <P>Reported by Kelly Bitner and
Deborah Potter. Because of other committements which keep her from
putting in the time she feels is required, Debbie Brinkeroff is
stepping down as President of the Central Chapter. The chapter had a
meeting in June which went very well. Everybody went around and told
the group what they were doing and what was going on in their lifes.
There was also discussion of changing the night of the week on which
they hold their meetings to try to increase attendance.</P>

<h4>EASTERN.</h4> <P>Kelly reported for Mercedes that
they will not be having any meetings til the Fall when classes
resume.</P>

<h4>NORTHERN.</h4> <P>Submitted by Margo Clark. On July
10, 1998 the Northern Chapter (LAWIS), held its annual summer picnic.
dede Collins was in charge of arranging the picnic. There were
approximately 35 members, visitors, and students in attendance. It
appears that holding the picnic during a long lunch-hour results in a
larger attendance as compared with having it after work hours. We
displayed several LAWIS related posters and the two quilts to be
auctioned at the State meeting in October. Approximately $60 in
lottery tickets were sold at the picnic.<BR>
The LAWIS Steering Committee held a meeting on July 8. At this
meeting it was proposed that our chapter consider holding some
workshops for teachers at the same time as the 1999 EYH conference.
Discussion was tabled until the next steering committee meeting.
Sharon Thomas will be putting together a proposal that examines
various options for resources and organization.</P>

<P>The lunch hour seminars arranged by Tinka Gammel
continue to be a great success. Recent or upcoming seminars are as
follows: 1) July 8, 1998 : "Sensitivity of Once Shocked, Weathered,
High Explosives" by Betty Harris, NMT-1, CMR, LANL. 2) August 4,
1998: "Massive exploding Stars: The Variability and Outbursts of
Luminous Blue Variable Stars" by Joyce Guzik, X-TA, LANL.</P>

<h4>SOUTHERN. </h4><P>Submitted by Karen
Saenz. We had a chapter meeting in May at Nancy Weinbrenner&#146;s
home. The meeting, a Thank You for all participants at the Expanding
Your Horizons conference held 23 April 1998 was held at Nancy
Weinbrenner&#146;s home in Las Cruces. Members attending were Karen
Saenz, Jane Madrid, Nancy Weinbrenner and Mary Bochmann; guests
attending were Stacey Bellavia, Nora Christianson, and Angela
Ferrara. The speaker was Ray Scalf. The talk, &#145;Creatures of the
Southwest&#146; was very interesting and we learned a lot. The
chapter decided to take the summer off and are looking for officiers
for next year.</P>

<h3>OLD BUSINESS</h3>

<h4>Dept. Of Education Letter.</h4> <P>Yolanda said
that she has received a draft of the letter that Lynda wrote, but
that it would be more effective if the letter came from attorney Gary
King. The Board agreed.</P>

<P>Debby Potter said that a member thought this letter might be in regards to a printing
bill. Lynda still has had no response and will follow up on
this.</P>

<h4>Bank Accounts. </h4><P>Kelly will write a letter to
the bank explaining that the State and Central bank accounts are two
separate accounts and should not be linked.</P>

<h4>Insurance for EYH. </h4><P>Adrianne had no report.
Margo Clark will check with LANL to see if the Northern Chapter is
covered during their EYH. Yolanda suggested that Math/Science Network
may have an umbrella policy of some sort.</P>

<h4>Scholarships. </h4><P>Yolanda having missed the
last meeting where the scholarship proposal was discussed in detail
brought up some important points. The money she brings in as
fundraising is for EYH, nothing else. So we can not use that money
for scholarships and the money market will not last very long with
the amounts and number of scholarships the board had decided on
previously. She also pointed out that scholarships of a few $100
aren&#146;t very useful in this day and age. The Board agreed and
will recommend that this issue be closed. An alternative to spending
the money of scholarships would be to increase the amount and number
of awards at the State Science Fair. We could use the interest from
the money market for this purpose, leaving the principle intact for
emergencies.</P>

<h3>NEW BUSINESS</h3>

<h4>Web Site. </h4><P>Carol reported that we may need
to move the NMNWSE web site from LANL. To get our own address, such
as <A HREF="http://www.nmnwse.org/"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>WWW.NMNWSE.ORG</B></FONT></A>
would cost a one time registration fee of $70 and $35 every two years
for renewal. TRAIL.COM would charge $50 for establishing our web site
on their server and then $5 every month. Some servers will give us a
free site because we are a non-profit organization. The Board
recommended that Carol proceed in obtaining a domain name and try to
get a free site. The cost of the domain name can be paid from
Publicity.</P>

<h4>Scholarships</h4> <P>Kelly and Jennifer have been
receiving requests from teachers, both in and out of NM, for Career
books. The Board decided that we would give up to 5 free books to a
NM teacher that requests copies and out-of-state teachers must buy
the books at cost $4 each plus shipping, and are limited to 5 books.
Requests for books should be forwarded to Kelly. Each Chapter should
count the number of books they have and report that to Kelly. We need
to make sure we have enough for next year&#146;s EYH. Jennifer will
try to work on a color master for the web version and will send an
electronic copy of the manuscript to dede to archive.</P>
