	<p>
		In October Yolanda King was honored by the UNM Alumni Association with a Zia Award.

	</p>
	<h2 align="center">NMNWSE Annual Meeting</h2> 
	<p>
		This year&acute;s meeting was held at the Explora Science Center and Children&acute;s Museum of Albuquerque. Attendees agreed that it should have been publicized sooner and more widely, but all those who attended felt the price, $50, was reasonable. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Next year&acute;s annual meeting is tentatively planned for Jemez Springs. 
	</p>

	<h4>EYH:</h4> 
	<p>
		Central Chapter has raised questions about the definition of an EYH sponsor. It was noted that all cash donors (state-wide and Chapter contributions) should be listed as sponsors, plus organizations that provide materials such as folders. Some people wanted every woman&acute;s work affiliation listed (speakers, tour leaders, planning committee, etc.) including specific Departments and branches of UNM. It seems appropriate that affiliations for women on the EYH Planning Committee are routinely listed (although they are not necessarily sponsors), but it was not recommended that the affiliation of all conference participants be listed. Discussion of the definition of EYH sponsor for consistency and Board policy was suggested. Do any employers have written agreements with the Network to receive recognition for EYH participation by their employees?

		Mary has distributed the Articles of Incorporation to all board members and will scan and store them as a .pdf file, available on request.

	<h4>Membership:</h4> 
	<p>
		Tinka is planning a party for members and potential members August 16 at her new home in Los Alamos, probably in the afternoon. A motion to have it catered was made by Tinka, seconded by Catherine. After some discussion, the motion was amended to place an upper limit of $250. The motion passed. Cater suggestions included Allied Foods and some other women-owned caterer. Tinka will send out the invitation and will also send out to the LAWIS mailing list 
	</p>
	<h4>Fund Raising:</h4> 
	<p>
		We have received a $5000 grant from the McCune Foundation. Debby indicated that we need more testimonials or formal reports on EYH conferences to use in grant proposals. There is $4-5K possible from the Sandia Foundation. Other possible donors suggested were Paul Newman&acute;s Own, PNM, the Albuquerque Community Foundation, Target has a $4k grant.

			The Silver City EYH conference at WNMU was held on Saturday, March 1, 2003, with about 160 5th-10th grade girls attending. There had 20 different workshops. The girls attended 2 workshops in the morning, lunch, 1 workshop and an activity in the afternoon. The only major problem was the lunch. They ate lunch at the school cafeteria which took too long due to long lines, slowness in deciding what to have for lunch, and staff shorthanded. Expenses were about $2000 and money raised was about $100 short. Adrienne also noted her new email address at dare@signalpeak.net.

		<dd>
			Tinka reported that there is no legal Board yet. This needs to be added as a tentative discussion for the next state Board meeting in August (at Tinka&acute;s). Should we do away with local chapters and just keep EYH planning committees? Debby proposed we do this strategic planning at the next meeting. Contacts to help &shy; Alexine can try to contact Gloria Cordova. Barbara will get together some ideas and email to Board. Dede will maintain the official summary copies.

	</p>
	<h4>Annual Meeting</h4> 
	<p>
		Final dates: weekend of October 18, with conference facilities booked at <i>Explora! Science Center and Albuquerque Children's Museum</i> for evening October 17 and all day October 18. It was also decided that there would be about an hour of strategic planning at the annual meeting. The theme selected was <i>Exploration: Past and Future.</i> 
	</p>
	<h4>Archives:</h4> 
	<p>
		It suggested that there be a poster board of our newsmakers at our annual meeting, possibly even a posthumous section. 
	</p>
	<h4>Membership:</h4> 
	<p>
		We have a total of 71 active members, including 5 new members. A suggestion was made to have a membership list available on line with a general password to all members. Georgia will look into the mechanisms available and get back with Carol 
	</p>
	<h4>Fund Raising:</h4> 
	<p>
		Total EYH funds raised for 2004 are $12,500 total raised this year amount to $17,800! THANK YOU, Debby!!! Debby has set up a new officer&acute;s notebook for the next Fundraising Chair who will be appointed by the incoming President in October. She would still like to re-create a history of past grant awards, since that information is requested on some grant applications. 
	</p>
	<h4>Policies and Procedures:</h4> 
	<p>
		Debby suggested specifying all EYH Chairs be network members. Also add to

	<h2 align="center">Highlights for October 19, 2003 Board Meeting</h2> 
	<p align="center">
		The meeting was held in Albuquerque in the Board Room at Northrop Grumman Mission Systems. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Attendance: dede Collins, Mercedes Agogino, Jeanne Banks, Barbara Torres, Yolanda King, Catherine Hensley, Tinka Gammel and Adrienne Dare. 
	</p>
	<h4>Treasurer's Report</h4> 
	<p>
		Current funds are in excess of $12,000 due to Debby Potter&acute;s very successful fundraising. 
	</p>
	<h4>Annual Meeting</h4> 
	<p>
		2003 &ndash; Jeanne Banks This year&rsquo;s symposium/meeting should have been better publicized, and sooner, to have been better attended. All who attended deemed the price reasonable. 2004 &ndash; ??? 
	</p>
	<p>
		dede will be asking Janie Enter to chair next year&rsquo;s event. Janie is interested in pursuing holding the meeting in Jemez Springs. The dates agreed upon where 24-25 September 04, with the Board Meeting on 26 September 04. 
	</p>
	<h4>Elections &ndash; dede Collins (spoke for Janie Enter)</h4> 
	<p>
		The elections were not complete prior to the meeting, but the call for nominations was sent via email to the membership list, the LAWIS listserv and the NMNWSE listserv on August 29. A copy of the letter sent is on file. Janie was unable to complete the evaluation of the responses before some required travel sent her out of town. The election process will be completed in November. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The 2004-2005 Elections will be chaired by dede Collins. 
	</p>
	<h4>Website</h4> 
	<p>
		Carol LaDelfe is passing the baton after doing such a marvelous job on the web page for so many years. Catherine and Tinka agreed to form a team to support the newsletter and the web page since they share so much information. They also agreed to help Adrienne put a web site on-line for the southern EYH. 
	</p>
	<h4>Policies and Procedures</h4>
	<p>
		Barbara agreed to continue to lead this area. The only changes to the policies and procedures that were made during the past year were done in the spring and reported in the minutes at that time. 
	</p>
	<p>
		There was also some discussion about a previous change to the P&amp;Ps that does not seem to be reflected in the current P&amp;P document. This change involved P&amp;P 96-POL2 concerning the $10 chapter rebate for each professional membership. The change, recalled by several at the board meeting, would provide a minimum amount for chapters with very few members but that want to remain active and rebuild as opposed to the $10 per member. Some research will be done in this area to determine if the change was indeed approved but simply lost in the documentation over time.
	</p>

	<p>
		It suggested that there be a poster board of our newsmakers at our annual meeting, possibly even a posthumous section.

			The fee to the Math/Science Network is now $500. This amount grants us the rights to hold each conference and includes the additional funds requested to send multiple copies of the materials to each site coordinator. Dana questions if this is worth it and do we know how the Math/Science Network uses the funds. Of course, the right to call the conference &ldquo;Expanding Your Horizons&rdquo; and use of the EYH logo are part of what we receive, plus the materials that are sent. Dana will take action to contact the Network and ask about the fee and how it is used.

			The Silver City EYH conference is scheduled at WNMU on March 6, 2004. The format will be similar to previous conferences: opening session, two workshops, lunch, another workshop, group activity, and closing session. There will be a keynote speaker at the opening session: a woman who is a graduate of one of the local area high schools. She works for IBM in Tucson and contacted us after last year&rsquo;s conference volunteering to help. 
			<br>
			We will aim for 250 girls in grades 5-10. We&rsquo;ve received a mini-grant of $100 from NM-AAUW to help provide transportation to girls from remote areas. After talking to some of the superintendents of four nearby school districts, they have agreed to provide transportation and help some with lunch expenses. One is even helping pay for t-shirts.
