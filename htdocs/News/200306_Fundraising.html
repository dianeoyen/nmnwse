<h2>June 2003 EYH Fund-Raising
Report</h2>

<p>by Deborah Potter, Vice
President / President-Elect NMNWSE</p>



<p>We received the first grant
award for 2004 -- a $5,000 check from the McCune Foundation in Santa Fe.  On
April 22, 2003, I met with Gary Miller to discuss a potential grant from Sandia
Foundation.  The meeting was favorable, and he provided some suggestions for
future proposals, such as providing statistics for the number of volunteers,
students and adults associated with each conference.  Although I gave him the
EYH testimonial by ³Tammy² posted on our website, he requested additional
testimonials.  Therefore, letters to Chapters or from archives were requested
of Board members.  </p>


<p>A thank-you letter was mailed
to the McCune Foundation and a grant application was mailed to Albuquerque
Community Foundation.  We are also waiting to hear whether awards will be
granted by [Paul] Newman&acute;s Own, PNM or Sandia Foundation.  </p>
