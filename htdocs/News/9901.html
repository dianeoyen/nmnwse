<CENTER><H2>PRESIDENTS MESSAGE</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2">by Karen Saenz</FONT></CENTER>

<P>I am not much of a procrastinator, but I have
found that the "words of wisdom" I expected to write were not
forthcoming and this task especially daunting. So instead, I wish you all a happy
and safe holiday season. Several comments I heard at the Annual Meeting
touched on the subject of networking and how we as a group are doing.
Such as, gosh, I hardly ever see you, nice to see you again, wouldn't it be
nice to meet again before a year is up.. It appears to me that the
"networking" part is being neglected and even though we all are busy, some of us can
get together at other times to renew friendships and gain new ones if
events are planned and scheduled. Since 1999 is our 20th year, what do you think
about having a special meeting at the June 5th board meeting? Margo,
dede, and I are tossing around ideas to extend an invitation to all the
members, visiting a museum (the O'Keefe was mentioned), and having a
potluck or meal at a restaurant after. And, at the February 6th board meeting,
we are meeting at Wyona Turner's home in El Paso. After the meeting,
the board and any others will adjourn to a local restaurant where we can
"network". Any member is welcome, but please call Wyona for a
headcount. </P>

<P>As President, I would like to again visit each
EYH conference. I don't expect nor plan to participate in your program
per se, but as was done in the past, I would like to visit and extend the
State Network's support to each conference. I'd also, depending on time, like
to visit each chapter at one of their regular meetings. I don't expect to
attend all, but I do expect to get to several events. One of my personal goals is to
knit the Network closer together and to that end I hope to become
visible.</P>

<P>This first message also includes special thanks
to the Central Chapter, especially Rosalie Graves and Debby Potter, for
organizing the Annual Meeting. I enjoyed getting away from the office
and home, but more importantly, I enjoyed getting together with
other members to renew friendships and make a few new ones. And, a
very big thanks to Kelly Bitner, the outgoing President, for her
leadership last year and for her help during the transition.</P>

<P>On a different matter, Yolanda King is moving
to D.C. and has resigned from the Board. We will miss you, Yolanda, and
we thank you for your efforts at our Fundraising Chair. Now, we have
a Member-at-Large position and a chair available on the Board. Anyone
interested, please contact me.</P>

<P>See many of you in February.</P>

<P>Present: Karen Saenz, Kelly Bitner, Carol
LaDelfe, Rosalie Graves, dede Collins, Debbie Potter, Nancy
Weinbrenner, Wyona Turner, Angelique Neuman, Margo Clark, Lynda
Towers, Adrienne Dare.</P>


<h4>Call to Order: 8:00 am</h4>

<h3>Approval of Minutes: </h3> <P>Karen Saenz
read the minutes aloud. Minutes accepted as read.</P>

<h3>Treasurer&#146;s Report:</h3> <P>Deborah
Kubicek presented the financial status in the absence of the new
treasurer. The Treasurer&#146;s report was accepted. Deborah
suggested that all receipts be turned into the treasurer before the
annual meeting to facilitate closing the books for the year. Deborah
will make the deposit of all money collected during the Annual
Meeting.</P>

<h3>STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS</h3>

<H4>Annual Meeting</H4>

<P>The Annual Meeting and Technical Symposium of
the Network was held October 23-25, 1998 at La Sevilleta, near La
Jolla, New Mexico. Twenty members and one non-member registered in
advance of the conference. Four registration scholarships were
awarded. The keynote address, presented by Jeanne Banks of the
Central Chapter, was entitled "Y2K Computer Problems, Myths, and
realities". Twelve talks in all were presented. In addition to the
talks a tour of the explosives research facility at the New Mexico
Institute of Mining and Technology was conducted. A large dinner at
Val Verde Steakhouse in Socorro was held on Saturday night. The
Annual Meeting of the membership was held Saturday morning and the
Board of Directors meeting was held Sunday morning.</P>

<P>The financial report of the meeting includes:
Total income of $2045; Total Expenses $1242.54; with a Net Income of
$802.46. Seed money of $250 was received from the Board and will be
reimbursed to it. No childcare was requested. The committee awarded
four scholarships, and $200 is requested for this line item. Only one
registration cancellation was received by the chair before the
meeting. The registration check was returned to the registrant and
thus does not appear under "canceled registrations."</P>

<P>The annual meeting committee consisted of
chair, Rosalie Graves; program organizer and LTER liaison, Debby
Potter; tour organizers, Yolanda King and Ronda Cole; food
arrangements, Beulah Woodfin; and child care, Kelly Bitner. Thanks go
to the LTER staff for housing and meeting facility
arrangements.</P>

<P>Nina Thayer, dede Collins, and Lynda Towers
volunteered to chair the 1999 Annual Meeting. They are thinking about
Ghost Ranch as a location.</P>

<P>Debby Potter asked if the seed money had to be
refunded. Deborah Kubicek said that it does not.</P>

<h3>Archives</h3>

<P>No report.</P>

<h3>Elections</h3>

<P>The results of the FY1999 elections were
reported at the annual meeting of the membership. Special thanks goes
to Past-President, Kelly Bitner. Let&#146;s all acknowledge our new
President, Karen Saenz (Southern Chapter) and President-Elect, Carol
LaDelfe (Northern Chapter) and welcome Claudia Lewis and Angelique
Neuman to the Board. Note that Carol LaDelfe holds an at-large
position for the second year of her term. Let&#146;s express our
gratitude to all the Board members with a round of
applause!</P>

<P>The next election (October 1999) will need a
candidate for the position of VP/President-Elect from Central
Chapter. The terms of three Members-At-Large will expire  - 
Yolanda Jones King, Carol LaDelfe, and dede Collins. The
Secretary&#146;s position to which Jennifer Siders was elected will
also expire: if we are lucky, Kristin Bennett will accept a
nomination to continue!</P>

<P>Note that one ballot was returned without votes
due to an objection concerning mailing labels that were placed on the
bottom of the ballot. Some members returned their ballots with the
bottoms cut off or labels removed. Nearly all ballots contained the
optional signature. Note that the bylaws and policies and procedures
do not require a secret ballot, only a written ballot. Perhaps this
matter could be addressed by the Board to see if a policy revision is
warranted. If you&#146;d like to be on the Elections Committee,
please contact the new Elections Chair. She could use help with
applying postage and mailing labels, reproductions, counting the
ballots, etc.</P>

<P>The notebook I&#146;m passing to the new
Elections Chair includes a sample ballot, chronology of past officers
and minor revisions to the job description. It also contains a
computer disk with ballots, reports, etc.</P>

<P>This year we received 32 ballots from the
membership. NMNWSE members Debby Potter, Jeanne Banks, and Barbara
Torres counted the results. No write-in votes were received. Except
for one abstention, members unanimously voted for the unopposed
candidates. The abstention was due to placement of address labels on
the ballot. Note that 18 ballots included optional
signatures.</P>


<P>The following positions have been filled by
election of the membership:</P>

<blockquote><P>Vice President/President Elect: Carol
LaDelfe</P>

<P>Treasurer: Claudia Lewis</P>

<P>Member-at-large: Adreinne Dare</P>

<P>Member-at-large: Wyona Turner</P>

<P>Member-at-large: J. Margo Clark</P>

<P>Member-at-large: Angelique Neuman</P></blockquote>

<P>NOTES: All terms are 2 years except President
and President Elect are one-year terms. Candidates for Vice
President/President Elect rotate among chapters. Resigned positions
are filled by appointment of the President for the remainder of the
term. Kristin Bennett will assume the responsibilities of Secretary
until the term of Jennifer Siders expires.</P>

<P>Continuing Board members for FY99 are President
Karen Saenz, Past President Kelly Bitner, Secretary Kristin Bennett,
At-Large Members Carol LaDelfe, Yolanda Jones King and dede
Collins.</P>



<P><b><I>Congratulations to all!</I></b></P>


<h3>Fundraising</h3>

<P>Yolanda King sent a report by Debby Potter as
proxy. Total for 1997-1998 is $9,120, with $1,850 being from next
year&#146;s fund raising drive. Due to a busy fall schedule, I had to
do the mailing earlier than usual. Statewide donations are as
follows: Academy Corporation ($500), Allied Signal ($1000), Applied
research Associates ($250), BDM Technologies ($300), Bradbury &amp;
Stamm Construction ($200), Ethicon, Inc. ($250), Furr&#146;s ($20
gift certificate), Honeywell ($1,000), Intel ($1,000), Norwest Banks
($750), Phillips Petroleum ($3000), PNM ($250), The Old Bats ($50),
and UIE ($50).</P>

<P>I submitted several full proposals during the
year asking for funding for the reprinting of the EYH careers
booklet. Funding responses were great!! I have tried again this year
to get our bank account up for the next printing.</P>

<P>The raffle will add even more funds into the
booklet printing line. Many thanks to the Old Bats Quilting Guild,
Jeff Potter, Barbara Torres, and Rosalie Graves for the wonderful
prizes. Funds raised by the raffle will have to be determined after
the Annual Meeting, but is estimated to be close to
$1000!!</P>

<P>Thanks to other Board members for getting me
the copy of the audit report, EYH budgets, Board Member information
and EYH flyers that are needed in many of the
proposals.</P>


<P><B>Remember to report local sponsors to me. I
would like a copy of the EYH reports as well for demographics ---
which are often requested in proposal
applications</B>.</P>

<P>There is a difference between the finance
report and the fundraising report because the fundraising report uses
a different fiscal year. Deborah Kubicek and Yolanda Jones King will
discuss the discrepancy.</P>


<h3>Membership</h3>

<P>Wyona Turner presented the membership report.
In 1997-1998, there were 90 professional members, 8 retired members,
and 13 student or unemployed members, for a total of 111 members Two
new members joined since last Board meeting  -  Marlene Brown
(Central) and Claudia Mader (Northern).As of today, there are 44
members, five of them are new.</P>

<P>Claudia Mader joined in the last quarter and
wanted to know if she had to pay again. This is hard for members that
join late in the year. Some suggestions are: pro-rate the next
year&#146;s dues or hold the check until October 1. For Claudia Mader
specifically, the Northern Chapter will discuss whether to pay
Claudia&#146;s membership dues. Wyona will hold off on responding to
Claudia until the Northern Chapter has decided.</P>


<h3>Newsletter</h3>

<P>Carol LaDelfe reported on the newsletter.
Newsletters were compiled and distributed in November, February, May,
and August of 1998. Jennifer Siders compiled and edited the August
issue. All issues were also posted on the web site. The newsletter is
usually distributed quarterly  -  the month after the Annual
Meeting and every three months after that.</P>

<h3>Policy and Procedures</h3>

<P>No report.</P>

<h3>Publicity</h3>

<P>No report.</P>

<h3>Science Fair</h3>

<P>No report from Mercedes Agogino. However,
Angelique Neuman and Wendee Brunish volunteered to be Science Fair
judges, as did most of the Board members because the Board meeting
will be held at the Science Fair. Wendee Brunish also volunteered to
help organize the judges. Another "thank you" letter was received
along with an abstract. Carol LaDelfe will put it on the web
site.</P>

<h3>Expanding Your Horizons</h3>

<h4>State</h4>

<P>Adrienne Dare reported on the State EYH. It is
time to register with the Math/Science Network for next years&#146;
conferences. The Agency fee for up to 5 sites is $200. If we want
direct mailing of materials to the different sites that will be
$30/site. Last year some of the copies of the materials sent to you
was of poor quality. It was decided not to request individual mailing
of materials.</P>

<P>I have 864 career booklets at my house. Out of
that we will need 400 for next years&#146; EYH conferences (Central
will need 50, Southern will need 200 and Silver City will need 150.
Central currently has 100 and Northern has 250). Therefore there are
464 career booklets that won&#146;t be needed for next years&#146;
conferences.</P>

<P>The Math/Science Network does not have any
information about liability insurance. Rosalie Graves volunteered to
ask a lawyer in her firm who specializes in insurance about
suggestions for what to ask for and where to go for
insurance.</P>

<h4>Albuquerque EYH</h4>

<P>Rosalie graves reported for Nan Founds on the
Albuquerque EYH. Plans for the EYH conference in Albuquerque in March
1999 are well underway. Chairing the EYH is Nan Founds. The EYH will
be held at UNM and room arrangements have been completed. A vice
president from Allied Signal has been contacted to give the keynote
talk and has agreed to speak. A mailing to potential presenters was
made about the first of October. The January Central Chapter meeting
will be held at Nan&#146;s home and will be a working EYH meeting in
which the envelopes will be stuffed for the large mailing to the
schools. The brochures that will be sent to the schools will have
presentation titles.</P>

<P>Anita Reiser is heading the scheduling effort.
She did this for 800 students in Pittsburgh and has her
school/teacher database already set up to assign kids to sessions and
mail confirmations. Anita will be collecting checks and giving them
to Beulah Woodfin, EYH treasurer.</P>

<P>The organizing committee has been meeting with
outside groups to get their help. Nan has met with the AAUW and gave
them presenter information. Kim Linder is sending out information to
companies and Navajo groups. Nan is planning for unusual talks
including potters to talk about the science of pottery and setting up
small businesses. The committee is currently meeting monthly at the
Coronado Club on base and includes Nan Founds, Kim Linder, Anita
Reiser, Yolanda King, and Kelly Bitner. More help would be
appreciated, just call Nan.</P>

<h4>Los Alamos EYH</h4>

<P>No report.</P>

<h4>Las Cruces EYH</h4>

<P>Karen Saenz reported on the Las Cruces EYH. The
Chapter EYH will be held 18 March 1999 at White Sands Missile Range.
We will keep the same format as last year. To date, four presenters
have agreed to lead a workshop again next year. We are having the EYH
in conjunction with Women&#146;s History Month here at WSMR. We also
expanded the duties of the Student Ambassadors to include helping the
presenters run experiments. We hope to have pizza for lunch this year
and do the printing in-house to save funds.</P>

<h4>Silver City</h4>

<P>Adrienne Dare reported on the Silver City EYH.
The financial results of the 1998 conference are: total receipts:
$1,786; total expenses: $2,121.25. The net was ($335.25). The 1999
EYH conference is scheduled for Saturday, February 27 on the WNMU
campus. We will plan for 150 girls. We will also plan an adult
session. The planning is just beginning.</P>

<h3>Chapter Reports</h3>

<h4>Central</h4>

<P>Rosalie Graves presented the Central Chapter
report. The first meeting of 1998 was held at Rosalie Graves&#146;
home on Tuesday September 22. The first meeting was primarily a
planning meeting: plans for the Annual Meeting and plans for the year
were made. Meeting dates for 1998-1999 are Thursday November 12 at
Yannis restaurant with Betsy Frederick hostess; Wednesday January 20,
1999 at Nan Founds&#146; home, a working EYH meeting; April 21, 1999
at Debby Brinkerhoff&#146;s home, with a speaker to be obtained by
Yolanda Jones King; and June 17, 1999 at Ellen Evans&#146; home, a
social with a celebration of the 20 anniversary of the Network. EYH
plans were also discussed and reported separately. Possibilities for
putting out the word about chapter meetings were discussed: DOE
newsletters/web-sites, Sandier, UNM, and Unum&#146;s Valencia Campus
newsletters. Officers for 1998-1999 are interim president, Yolanda
Jones King; secretary, Rosalie Graves; and treasurer, Debby
Brinkerhoff.</P>

<h4>Eastern</h4>

<P>No report.</P>

<h4>Northern</h4>

<P>Report to be submitted by Margo Clark.</P>

<h4>Southern</h4>

<P>Karen Saenz made the report on the Southern
Chapter. We have no officers so far. The members agreed to cancel any
regular meetings and concentrate on organizing the EYH in March. I
continue to expect help for the local FEW and EEO with the
conference.</P>

<h3>Old Business</h3>

<P>Education letter  -  tabled until Yolanda
is present and can provide an update.</P>

<P>Bank accounts  -  table until new
treasurer has a chance to decide on a new bank.</P>

<P>Insurance for EYH  - LANL does not have
event insurance. In Silver City it is unclear whether events are
covered. The VP of Business Affairs thought the EYH should have
insurance. We will get quotes for state-wide or individual events.
Rosalie will consult with an attorney about liability limits and
other aspects of coverage that we should know about.</P>
