<h2>Publicity Chair Report - Kim Linder</h2> 
<p>
	There are two awards we should look at nominating someone for. Recall the idea for nominating someone for these awards is multipurpose: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		help make the Network visible in the state 
	</li>
	<li>
		award the hard work of our members 
	</li>
	<li>
		encourage involvement in the Network from the nominated members 
	</li>
	<li>
		4.support these state woman's programs 
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Keep in mind, whomever is nominated will have to be willing to write up a 500, or so, word summary on their achievements. I am willing to assist in this, if desired. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>FIRST,</b> We need to select someone for the <b>2003 Governors Award</b>. 
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		FYI, they have discontinued the Estralla Award: 
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			<i>&quot;Thank you for your interst in the Estrella Award however the Commission has discontiued this particular award program - Kathi Brown&quot; </i> 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		This is what the Trailblazer Award was under that Kelly Bitner was awarded last year. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<u>Criteria</u> 
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			This prestigious award honors 20 women, selected from statewide nominations, for their exceptional contributions and achievements. Appointed by the governor, judges award women for their extra efforts to improve the status of women in our state. They are rated on community leadership, effectiveness of advocacy for positive change for women and families, and leadership in their careers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Nomination deadline for 2003 is Friday, February 23</b> 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		<u>Submission Requirements </u> 
	</p>
	<p>
		Eight complete packets with nomination form, summary and supportive materials. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<u>500 word summary Summarize the nominee's specific achievements, the impact of her contributions to her community and/or the people of New Mexico, the individual style and characteristics she uniquely possesses as a leader, and a brief statement on why she deserves the award. This summary may be used for publication purposes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Supportive Materials: The material should justify consideration of the nominee. You may want to include biographical data; leadership or community roles with quantifiable results; commitments; mentorship volunteer and compensated advocacy work; and/or newspaper or magazine articles. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A $15 contribution payable to the Commission is welcomed to support the Commission's Conference Fund. 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	<b>SECOND</b>, We need to select someone for the <b>YWCA</b> <b>Women on the Move Award</b> 
</p><b.ockquote>
<p>
	<u>Criteria</u> 
</p>
<p>
	Women on the Move is a national YWCA recognition program honoring women who have made significant contributions to their communities and professions. 
</p>
<p>
	Here is the best I have been able to get from them: 
</p>
<p>
	<i>&quot;The nomination forms should be ready today [Dec. 5]. I can send you a PDF format of 
		<br>
		it. The early bird deadline is January 13, and the final deadline is January 20. I'll keep you posted. &quot;</i> 
</p>
<p>
	At any rate, we need to have someone nominated and ready to go. I will get them the nomination materials as soon as they arrive. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
	<b>THIRD</b>, I will be finalizing the brown wrapper after this meeting to make the deadline. I have received some feedback via email, and have attached the latest version. The brown wrapper will appear in the Journal and Tribune, randomly throughout the year (free of charge). 
</p>
<p>
	<b>FINALLY!</b> I submitted an advertisement to NM Kids! Magazine for EYH for the state (see below). The magazine will come out in Jan/Feb. The central EYH advertised in this last year and got a good response. This magazine is distributed across the entire state. I am working with them to try and get an article about EYH in the magazine.
