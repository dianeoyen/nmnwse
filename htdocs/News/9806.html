         <P><FONT SIZE="+1">We successfully completed four Expanding Your Horizons
         (EYH) conferences. Many thanks to the committees that made
         these happen and the presenters who shared their knowledge
         and experience with the young girls. The EYH participants
         got a special gift this year  -  a copy of our new
         careers handbook, called "Careers: Exploring the
         Possibilities". This is an exceptional publication,
         professionally done, and very well written. Every time I
         read the book I wish that I could start all over again,
         because each career description sounds so interesting and
         exciting. If you haven&#146;t seen it yet, check it out on
         our web page. A big hand to all the contributors, but
         particularly to Anne Mauzy, Vicky Ide, and Jennifer Siders
         for making it all happen.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Publishing the careers booklet was made possible by the
         monumental fund-raising efforts by Yolanda Jones King. In
         the midst of full-time work and election campaigns, Yolanda
         has raised more money than in any previous year. But we
         can&#146;t stop there. The donations cover the publishing
         cost, but don&#146;t leave us any for the usual expenses. We
         all have the opportunity to raise some money for the Network
         by selling raffle tickets. Deborah Kubicek used her quilting
         connections to get two beautiful quilts donated for raffling
         and Debby Potter was also able to use her connections to get
         a beautiful print donated as well. With these wonderful
         prizes, it is easy to sell the raffle tickets. Please
         participate in this fund raising effort.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1">I sent out an e-mail asking for your ideas on how to
         increase membership and increase participation by the
         members. I have received some responses with good ideas, but
         we could really use more ideas. Please give it some thought
         and send them to me, either by mail to the Network address,
         by email to kellybitner@mactec_nm.com, or call me at (505)
         242-7525.</FONT></P>

         <P>The meeting was held in conjunction with the NM Science
         Fair and was called to order at 9.03 a.m. at New Mexico Tech
         Those in attendance were Lynda Towers, Kelly Bitner, Debby
         Brinkerhoff, Karen Saenz, Adrienne Dare, Yolanda Jones King,
         Deborah Kubicek, Debby Potter and Jennifer Siders. The
         meeting was held at the Vancouver Suites in Las Cruces
         following the Annual Meeting.</P>
         
         <P>The minutes from the August meeting were reviewed and
         approved. The Treasurer&#146;s report was given by Deborah
         Kubicek. Year to date income of $6736.46 and expenses of
         $5677.89. The Audit reported no discrepancies. Reports were
         given by Committee Chairs. The meeting adjourned at 11:30
         a.m.</P>
         
         <H3>Standing Committee Reports</H3>
         
         <H3>Annual Meeting</H3>
         
         <P>Submitted by Karen Saenz. There were eight rooms reserved
         at the Vancouver Suites for the Annual Meeting. The hotel
         was fantastic, great rates that kept dropping as the meeting
         approached. The next Annual Meeting will be organized by the
         Central Chapter and they are looking for a volunteer.</P>
         
         <H3>Archives</H3>
         
         <P>No Report. dede agreed to continue as Archives Chair.</P>
         
         <H3>Elections</H3>
         
         <P>Submitted by Debby Potter</P>
         
         <P>Carol LaDelfe of Northern Chapter is nominee for
         President Elect. Terms that expire in Oct. 1998 include
         Treasurer and the At-Large Board positions of Potter, Dare,
         Turner and Schultz-Paige.</P>
         
         <P>Vice President Karen Saenz will serve as President next
         year. We will <B>need a nominee for Treasurer</B> to follow
         in the footsteps of Deborah Kubicek.. Those who would like
         to continue serving the Board include Adrienne Dare and
         Wyona Turner. Debby Potter is still thinking about it, but
         we will need <B>at least one nominee for At-Large
         Member.</B></P>
         
         <H3>Fundraising</H3>
         
         <P>Yolanda will continue the fundraising effort but will
         probably not have as much time to write individual proposals
         this year. Kelly Bitner volunteered to help with
         fundraising. Possibility of a fund-raiser was brought
         up.</P>
         
         <H3>Membership</H3>
         
         <P>Submitted by Wyona Turner, who will continue as
         Membership Chair. Currently there are 94 professional
         members, 7 retired, 19 students/unemployed for a total of
         120 members. Membership renewal notices were sent to current
         members in mid-September. Costs incurred: $59.08. In
         coordinating membership numbers with the Treasurer, a
         discrepancy was discovered in the listing of professional
         members in the Northern Chapter. The membership was
         overstated by one member. The above numbers reflect the
         correction.</P>
         
         <H3>Newsletter</H3>
         
         <P>Submitted by Carol LaDelfe, who will continue as
         Newsletter editor. The next Newsletter will be going out
         around the first of the year. Carol submitted a bill for $27
         for postage expenses.</P>
         
         <H3>State Science Fair</H3>
         
         <P>No report from Mercedes. Kelly will call Mercedes to let
         her know that she can call on the Publicity Chair, Jennifer
         Siders, for help with the Fair.</P>
         
         <H3>Policies &amp; Procedures</H3>
         
         <P>dede reported that she will update the bylaws and bring
         them to the next meeting. Lynda Towers will take over
         Policies and Procedures for the next year. Debby Potter read
         some of the comments from the election on the new
         by-law.</P>
         
         <H3>Publicity</H3>
         
         <P>Submitted by Jennifer Siders, who will continue as
         Publicity Chair. She sent a letter and the Call for Papers
         for the Annual meeting to women at New Mexico Tech, New
         Mexico Highlands University, St. John&#146;s College, Santa
         Fe College and emailed women faculty at San Juan College in
         Farmington. Letters went to women faculty, department
         chairs, or Dean of Faculty at each school. It was suggested
         by Board members to also contact the community colleges. We
         will be going to the State Science Fair again in the spring.
         Kelly will ask Mercedes to send information on the Fair to
         Jennifer as it becomes available.</P>
         
         <H3>EYH</H3>
         
         <P>Adrienne Dare agreed to continue as State EYH
         Coordinator. It is time to register our sites for the 1998
         EYH Conferences. The fee is $200. Adrienne will need the
         dates of the various conferences and the names and addresses
         of the contact person for each site.</P>
         
         <H3>EYH Reports</H3>
         
         <h4>CENTRAL </h4><P>March 14, 1998 Central Chapter held
         their EYH conference on Saturday March 14 at UNM. About 115
         women attended, with major interest in computer science,
         health sciences and law. There were about 32 presenters,
         many from outside the network. Welcoming remarks were
         delivered by NMNWSE President Kelly Bitner. Our Keynote
         Speaker, Rhea Graham, was inspirational and
         well-received.</P>
         
         <P>Co-Chairs Nan Founds and Debby Potter are grateful for
         the hard work of the Steering Committee: Dr. Yolanda King,
         Kelly Bitner, Debby Brinkerhoff, Ellen Evans, Dr. Judy
         Hendricks, Dr. Diane Marshall, Dr. Beulah Woodfin, Ronda
         Cole, Dr. Donna Senft, Dr. Mary Ann Sweeney, Anita Reiser,
         Dr. Aurelia Harris, Tessa Krause, Marilyn Morgan, and Dr.
         Kim Linder. We also commend the contributions from DOE
         Federal Women Employees Program and the Delta-Sigma-Theta
         sorority. Sorority members offered 20 scholarships,
         assembled the registration packets at no cost, and operated
         the registration desk. AlphaGraphics donated the copying of
         our registration materials which saved the chapter about
         $600 in reproduction costs. Although we don&#146;t have a
         final budget report, we surely avoided running a deficit
         this year.</P>
         
         <P>We thank all of our sponsors, including Albuquerque
         Public Schools, USDA Forest Service, U.S. Department of
         Energy, USAF Research Laboratory, UNM, UIE, PNM, Ethicon,
         Inc., Intel Corp., Applied Research Assoc., Bradbury &amp;
         Stamm Const., Cobre Mining, Phillips Petroleum, AlliedSignal
         Aerospace, Norwest Bank, Albuquerque Doubletree Hotel, Sun
         Valley Fruit Company and Price CostCo. Those home-made
         chocolate chip cookies from the Doubletree were a hit once
         again!</P>
         
         <P>The Chapter has several volunteers to organize EYH next
         year! We've pleased to have Anita Riser of Sandia Labs lead
         registration and student outreach by Kim Linder. Nan Founds
         of DOE offered to help the new leaders and has already held
         a meeting with them. We still need a computer guru to help
         with relational databases to match students and speakers, or
         the chapter may need to relent and give students fewer
         choices in the future. It was also suggested that since
         we&#146;ve had continued difficulty recruiting students,
         that overflow students who can not be accommodated by the
         Los Alamos Chapter be routed to Central Chapter. Kim also
         plans to assign Chapter members to visit schools. Other
         suggestions included hanging EYH announcement posters at
         schools. Since many of the conference registration forms
         were printed from the NMNWSE web site, provisions for online
         registration may be a good idea. Girl Scout Councils will
         also help register students, but they will need early
         notice. Beth from the zoo can provide speakers&#146;
         training. Board members suggested sending a Chapter member
         to speak about EYH at the APS Principals&#146; meetings.
         Pros and cons of working with school counselors were
         discussed. Another suggestion was to contact the Math
         Science Network for help with data bases.</P>
         
         <h4>NORTHERN</h4><P>Carol reported that there have been no
         meetings yet. The first planning meeting will be in December
         and the conference will probably by in March.</P>
         
         <h4>SILVER CITY</h4> <P>Adrienne reported that the Silver City
         Conference is scheduled for Saturday, Feb. 21, 1998 at
         Western New Mexico University. We have just begun the
         planning for the conference. Prospective presenters have
         been contacted. For the second year we plan to have an adult
         program along with the conference for girls.</P>
         
         <h4>LAS CRUCES</h4> <P>Submitted by Karen Saenz. At our last
         meeting, the Chapter decided to have the EYH conference
         later in the year. The date will be April 23, 1998 at White
         Sands Missile Range. We also decided to structure the day's
         activities differently. We can have a max of 200 students;
         25 to a group; each group will attend 4 group activities.
         Teachers and high school students from Mayfield High in Las
         Cruces have expressed an interest to help. The Youth
         Activities Coordinator, Jim Salvador, from WSMR, also plans
         to help organize the event and provide group activity
         leaders.</P>
         
         <H3>CHAPTER REPORTS</H3>
         
         <h4>CENTRAL</h4> <P>No report. Debby Potter noted the Chapter
         is in need of officers, members and volunteers to help with
         the Annual Meeting.</P>
         
         <h4>EASTERN</h4> <P>No report.</P>
         
         <h4>NORTHERN</h4> <P>Submitted by Carol LaDelfe. Tinka
         continues to organize lunch time talks. Election of new
         officers is in progress.</P>
         
         <h4>SOUTHERN</h4> <P>Submitted by Karen Saenz. Chapter members
         agreed to continue to hold chapter meetings in members'
         homes with meals catered. I agreed(?) to continue as
         President and Jane Madrid agreed to be the Vice-President.
         We need chapter members to volunteer to fill the Treasurer
         and Secretary posts. Most business conducted was the final
         preparation for the Annual Meeting in October. **Thanks
         Nancy for chairing this event. Others and I appreciate your
         efforts.*** Our next meeting will be 12 November. The place
         and speaker are yet to be determined. The meal will be deli
         subs.</P>
         
         <H3>Old Business</H3>
         
         <h4>SURVEYING YOUR FUTURE </h4>
         <P>Revision of the booklet is
         in progress. Ann has received 17 updated articles and is
         expecting more. Still looking for someone to update the
         article on Math. Yolanda and Liz Ranks might know someone
         who would do it. Need to send them the article.</P>
         
         <P>Other possibilities for funding the printing of the
         booklet were discussed. Yolanda will check with UNM Press
         and Siders will ask Jennifer Roper to contact NM Tech since
         Roper mentioned they might be interested in helping. dede
         will check with LANL about printing. The booklet needs a new
         name since the old one is copyrighted. 'Exploring
         Possibilities' was mentioned.</P>
         
         <h4>MUTUAL FUNDS </h4>
         <P>Deborah Kubicek reported that we need
         a minimum of $5000 to keep the Mutual Fund open. Presently
         Rosalie Graves and Barbara Torres are authorized to sign on
         the account. To change the names we need a letter of
         instruction and copy of corporate resolution (Non-profit
         Corp. report, or a copy of the minutes should suffice). A
         motion to change the signatures to Treasurer, President, and
         Vice-President was made by Carol, seconded by Lynda -
         passed.</P>
         
         <h4>DEPT. OF EDUCATION letter</h4> <P>Debby Potter said that a
         member thought this letter might be in regards to a printing
         bill. Lynda still has had no response and will follow up on
         this.</P>
         
         <H3>New Business</H3>

         on the scholarships discussed at the Annual Meeting and will
         be preparing a proposal to submit to the board.</P>

         Bitner will call Judy and thank her for all her help.</P>
         
         <h4>EYH MONEY</h4> <P>Yolanda stated that we can not afford to
         increase the EYH Seed Money until after we pay for the
         printing of the booklet. It was decided by the Board to keep
         the same amount.</P>
         
         <P>The overrun of the Central Chapter and their request for
         reimbursement was discussed at length. In the end it was
         decided to pay $130 (approximately half of their loss) to
         the Central Chapter. The Board was not comfortable
         reimbursing all of their loss because of the expense of the
         printing the booklet this year. Moved by Debby, seconded by
         Carol passed.</P>
         
         <h4>FUNDRAISING</h4> <P>Yolanda asked the Board for ideas,
         foundations that she could write to, etc. The possibility of
         holding a raffle was discussed. Deborah is going to check
         with her quilting group to see if they would donate a quilt
         for a raffle. She would like to show them a SYF booklet so
         they can see what they would be working for. Debby Potter
         will talk to her husband about raffling a painting. Yolanda
         said she could print up the raffle tickets.</P>
         
         <h4>INCREASING MEMBERSHIP</h4> <P>Board discussed briefly ways
         of increasing Network membership and increasing activity of
         members. Tabled to next meeting.</P>
         
         <h4>AWARDS</h4> 
         <P>Kelly stated that she would like to have a database of
         awards that we could nominate people for. Awards like the
         Trailblazers, Governor's Award, YWCA, etc. Kelly will call
         (1-800-432-9168) to gather more information.</P>

         <P>The Meeting was called to order at 9:10am. Those in
         attendance were Kelly Bitner, Adrienne Dare, Debby Potter,
         Margo Clark, Wyona Turner, Carol LaDelfe and Jennifer
         Siders. The meeting was held in Silver City at the home of
         Adrienne Dare. Kelly Bitner, President of the Network,
         suggested that we run the Board meetings by consensus voting
         instead of Robert&#146;s Rules of Order. The Board members
         agreed to try it.</P>
         
         <P>The minutes, submitted by Jennifer Siders, for the April
         '98 meeting of the Board of Directors were accepted.</P>
         
         <h4>Treasurer&#146;s Report</h4>
         
         <P>Submitted by Jennifer Siders
         for Deborah Kubicek. Apr-May income was $454.56 with
         expenses of $713.13, with $7271.95 in the bank (checking and
         money market).</P>
         
         <h3>Standing Committee Reports.</h3>
         
         <h4>ANNUAL MEETING</h4>
         
         <P>Report submitted by Kelly Bitner for Rosalie Graves.
         Plans for the Annual Meeting and Technical Symposium were
         discussed at the June Central Chapter meeting. Debby Potter
         passed out color copies of the Call for Papers and included
         black-and-white copies in the Central Chapter meeting
         announcement mailing. Rosalie Graves discussed the
         possibility of sending out a color copy to all the science
         and engineering academic departments around New Mexico and
         including a copy of the `Who We Are&#146; brochures with
         them. This would be an excellent opportunity to
         `reintroduce&#146; the Network to women around the state.
         About a hundred brochures and fliers would be needed. The
         State Board agreed that this was a good idea and Wyonna is
         going to send Rosalie a hundred brochures. Rosalie has
         agreed to work on the registration forms so that they can be
         sent out with the August newsletter mailing. Jeanne Banks
         has agreed to be the keynote speaker of the Y2K problems for
         the Annual Meeting, barring unforeseen travel problems.
         Rosalie noted that she had invited two of her ABWA
         scholarship students to give papers at the Annual Meeting.
         Debby Potter passed out color copies of the Call for Papers
         to Board members to distribute and post.</P>
         
         <h4>ARCHIVES</h4>
         
         <P>No report.</P>
         
         <h4>ELECTION</h4>
         
         <P>Submitted by Deborah Potter. Carol LaDelfe of Northern
         Chapter is nominee for President Elect. Terms that expire in
         Oct. 1998 include Treasurer and the At-Large Board positions
         of Potter, Dare, Turner, and Schultz-Paige. Vice President
         Karen Saenz will serve as President next year. We will need
         a nominee for Treasurer to follow in the footsteps of
         Deborah Kubicek. Those who decided to run for re-election to
         the Board include Adrienne Dare and Wyonna Turner. Margo
         Clark offered to help us as At-Large nominee. Chapter
         Presidents are asked to help find nominees for the ballot
         before the August board meeting. Please give Debby Potter
         the names of any nominees and their biographical sketch (one
         paragraph) to include with the ballot. Jennifer Siders noted
         that Board members should also be searching for a new
         Secretary as she will be moving to San Diego in mid-August
         and a new Secretary will have to be appointed to complete
         her term.</P>
         
         <h4>FUNDRAISING</h4>
         
         <P>Report submitted by Debby Potter for Yolanda King. For
         1998, the fundraising efforts have brought in $7270 (already
         received and pledged).</P>
         
         <h4>MEMBERSHIP</h4>
         
         <P>Submitted by Wyonna Turner. There are currently 88
         Professional members, 8 retired, and 13 students/unemployed
         for a total of 109 members. The database has been updated
         and directories were sent to new and renewed members since
         last report. Labels for the newsletter and annual meeting
         were produced and given to the appropriate Board members.
         Cost incurred were $8.08 for postage. New members include
         Katherine Crist (LANL), Kim Dietrich Elam
         (Leedshill-Herkenhoff, Inc.) and Patricia Vardaro-Charles
         (LANL).</P>
         
         <h3>NEWSLETTER</h3>
         
         <P>Report made by Carol LaDelfe. The next
         newsletter should be out within the next week. Carol
         requested a volunteer to do the next newsletter as she has
         just changed jobs and is too busy. Jennifer Siders
         volunteered to help with the August newsletter since most of
         it will be the minutes, which she already prepares. A new
         newsletter editor can be selected at the Board meeting at
         the Annual meeting when assignments to At-Large members are
         made.</P>
         
         <h3>POLICY AND PROCEDURES</h3>
         
         <P>No report.</P>
         
         <h3>PUBLICITY</h3>
         
         <P>Report made by Jennifer Siders. At the State Science Fair
         Wyonna suggested that we buy some pencils with the Network
         logo and web address to pass out. This could be a valuable
         publicity tool because at the State Science Fair we were
         constantly being asked for pencils by the judges. If we had
         a jar of pencils out we might get more attention from the
         judges. Pencils could also be used at the Annual Meeting and
         other events. I don&#146;t think I&#146;l have time to look
         into it before I leave for San Diego but will leave a note
         in the binder for the next Publicity Chair. The Careers book
         is now on-line as a PDF document off the Network&#146;s home
         page. I announced this development on an international
         listserve for women in science and engineering (WISENET) and
         know that a number of women downloaded it. A couple even
         expressed an interest in writing an article on their career.
         I also know of a hairdresser in NY that has a put a hard
         copy of our book, courtesy of my mother, in her booth for
         young girls to browse while they get their hair cut. So the
         Careers book appears to be a hit and is quickly making its
         way around the country.</P>

         <H3>EYH</H3>
         
         <h4>State Report</h4> 
         <P>Submitted by Adrienne Dare. I have received
         the EYH evaluations from the Southern and Central chapters.
         I will send these into the Math Science Network. I will be
         glad to send in the evaluation for the Northern Chapter if
         you can get that to me. Carol La Delfe said she would check
         on the whereabouts of the evaluation and get a copy to
         Adrienne.</P>
         
         <H3>EYH Chapter Reports.</H3>
         
         <h4>Central</h4>
         
         <P>Submitted by Debby Potter. Nan Founds will
         continue to work with the 1999 EYH team. Anita Riser of
         Sandia Labs will lead registration and Kim Linder will
         organize student outreach. Once again, Dr. Diane Marshall
         offered to help arrange facilities at UNM. They have already
         had two planning meetings for next years EYH! One of their
         biggest concerns is that they need to bring in more
         students. They are going to try using the Girl Scout Council
         to distribute information and possibly put an insert in the
         ABQ paper. The keynote speaker is from AlliedSignal, and
         will be completely paid for by AlliedSignal.</P>
         
         <h4>Northern</h4> 
         <P>Report made by Margo Clark. Thank you
         letters were sent to presenters and helpers and a party to
         celebrate the conclusion of this years EYH was held. Alexine
         Salazar will be the Chair for next years EYH. Jennifer
         Siders noted that she would be giving Alexine 5 boxes of
         Career books that she has. This is almost enough for two
         more years.</P>
         
         <h4>Las Cruces.</h4> 
         <P>Adrienne Dare reported for Karen Saenz
         that they had 226 students attend their EYH this April. Four
         boys attended and they had turn away 25 students. They used
         high school girls as student ambassadors and already have
         another high school that has volunteered for next year.</P>
         
         <h4>Silver City. </h4>
         <P>Submitted by Adrienne Dare. The
         Silver City EYH was held March 28. I do not have a final
         financial report because the treasurer has been out of town
         for several weeks.</P>
         
         <H3>Chapter Reports.</H3>
         
         <h4>Central</h4>
         
         <P>Submitted by Kelly Bitner for Debby
         Brinkerhoff. The Central Chapter met June 17<SUP>th</SUP> at
         Ellen Evans house. We had one of our larger attendances with
         10 women. Instead of a program we discussed what was
         happening in our lives and what we had been doing during the
         last year. We had a pleasant social with only a few items of
         business. Debby Potter passed out more call for papers for
         the Annual Meeting for the members to post at work.</P>
         
         <h4>Eastern.</h4> 
         <P>No Report.</P>
         
         <h4>Northern.</h4> 
         <P>Submitted by Margo Clark. Since our EYH
         conference in March, we held a thank-you party for all the
         workshop presenters, volunteers, `gofers&#146; and some
         financial contributors. This consisted of a pizza party held
         over the lunch period, where contributions were recognized
         and some thank-you gifts were distributed. Thank-you letters
         were also distributed. Approximately 25 women attended the
         thank-you party.</P>
         
         <P>The LAWIS Steering Committee met on June 11. One of the
         items on the agenda was to plan the annual summer picnic.
         Although we have been having a picnic immediately after work
         hours, this year we are experimenting and will be having
         this one over a long lunch-hour. It is tentatively scheduled
         for July 10, 1998 and might be held at Ashley Pond in Los
         Alamos. Hopefully, the attendance will be increased by
         having it during the lunch-hour. We plan to invite some of
         the summer students to the picnic.</P>
         
         <P>Tinka Gammel is still putting together great lunch time
         talks. Since the last Board meeting we have had the
         following speakers: Wendee Brunish gave a "Report on the
         25<SUP>th</SUP> Anniversary Conference on Women in Science
         and Engineering: choices and successes" and Jeanne Fair gave
         a talk on her graduate work, "The Ecological and
         Physiological Cost of Contaminants on Cavity Nesting Birds".
         Over 30 women attended Fair&#146;s talk!</P>
         
         <h4>Southern.</h4> <P>No Report.</P>
         
         <H3>Old Business</H3>
         
         <h4>SCHOLARSHIPS.</h4> <P>The scholarship proposal was
         discussed at great length and the following decisions were
         made.</p> 
         <ol><li>The maximum amount of money to be given out in
         scholarships will be determined by the Board at the October
         meeting and should be based on the budget.</li> 
         <li>A maximum of
         seven awards will be given so that one may be given to each
         of the seven schools (NMIMT, NMSU, UNM, ENMU, NMHU, WNMU and
         UTEP). But the review committee will consider all applicants
         equally for the awards so any one school may receive more
         than one award and some may receive none depending on the
         applications.</li> 
         <LI>Applications will be accepted from students at the University of Texas, El Paso.</li> 
         <LI>For this coming year the Board suggests that the awards be $200 each, for a total
         of $1400 to be budgeted for scholarships.</li> 
         <LI>It will be left
         up to the Review Committee to decide what they will consider
         to be Math/Science/Engineering.</li> 
         <LI>The timeline for the
         scholarship will be as follows: </li>
		<OL>
			<li>Oct 98  -  decide dollar amount of scholarship,</li>
			<li>Jan 99 - information on scholarship should be distributed to schools/students,</li>
			<li>April 30, 1999  -  Application Deadline,</li>
			<li>May 15, 1999 - Announcement of scholarship winners. </li>
		</OL>
         <li>Scholarships will be available to current college students
         and high school seniors entering college.</li> 
         <li>High school seniors will need to show proof of acceptance to one of the
         seven schools while current students should provide proof of
         enrollment and intention to major in math, science or
         engineering.</li> 
         <li>Proof of enrollment in one of the seven colleges must be made to receive the scholarship money.</li> 
         <li>Volunteers for the Review Committee should be requested at the Annual Meeting.</li> 
         <li>The number of awards to actually be given in any one year shall be determined by the Review
         Committee, i.e. the Committee is not required to give out
         all seven awards.</li></ol>
         
         <h4>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION letter.</h4> 
         <P>Kelly will contact
         Lynda Towers to remind her to write a letter for Gary King
         to look over.</P>
         
         <h4>BANK ACCOUNT</h4>
         <P>No report.</P>
         
         <h4>INSURANCE FOR EYH</h4>
         <P>Submitted by Adrienne Dare.
         According to the Math Science Network it is crucial for each
         site to have liability insurance. Each Chapter should check
         with their host site and see if they are covered, and
         request positive evidence of such coverage. Yolanda might be
         able to provide more information on insurance companies that
         provide this kind of one-day event coverage and what the
         rates will be. Adrienne will check with the Math Science
         Network to see if they have any recommendations. It was
         mentioned that it should probably be added to the policies
         and procedures, that each EYH should have event coverage.
         This will be postponed until we know more.</P>

         <h4>Increasing Membership.</h4> <P>Kelly Bitner lead a
         discussion on ways to increase membership. She had sent an
         email previously requesting ideas. Some of the responses
         were - ask a TV station to do a public service announcement
         on EYH, have FUN meetings, bring a friend to a meeting and
         your dinner is free, advertise in newspaper, have activities
         for children at meetings. Jennifer Siders suggested having
         field trips that involved the entire network similar to the
         recent field trip to Carlsbad that the Northern Chapter had.
         Field trips to Chaco, Carlsbad and White Sands might bring
         in more students and postdocs. It was also suggested to try
         using institutional communications (Intel, Sandia, etc.).
         Booths advertising the Network could be set up at Career
         Fairs, Science Fairs, various events of that sort. We
         already have a couple of posters that we use at the State
         Science Fair so all we need are volunteers to set up the
         booths.</P>
         
         <P>The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m.</P>
