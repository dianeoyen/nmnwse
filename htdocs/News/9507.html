<H3>PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE</H3>

<P>Greetings and salutations to all you wonderful members! I am so
excited about the growth of the Network this year! We are 160 strong
and growing!! This growth can be attributed to the hard work that
everyone has contributed, especially the Board of Directors. Even
though we are nearly three quarters of the way through the year, it
doesn't seem like it at all! Elections will be here before you know
it, so be thinking about whether you might like to jump in and
contribute. We have a lot of fun and get to know each other pretty
well by the end of the two-year term. I have served on the Board
previous to being President and found it very rewarding. With
staggered two-year terms, there is a lot of continuity and that makes
everyone's job easier.</P>

<P>I'm sure that you all have received the Call for Papers for the
Technical Symposium and Annual Meeting in October. As some of you
know, I gave a presentation of Self-care for Working Women last year.
It was a very rewarding experience and fun too!. This is truly a SAFE
environment to test out a presentation. I would encourage all of you
to come this year because we will be in the midst of nature and will
have a great opportunity to get to know each other better also!</P>

<P>I would like to personally thank Lynda Towers, Libby Haas, Debby
Potter, Vlctor1a Dery, and Karen Agoglno for taking time out of their
busy schedules and traveling to Socorro to judge and select winners
from the science fair projects. And a special THANK YOU to Mercedes
Agogino for taking charge every year and making these awards
possible! We have already received several thank you notes from
recipients of our awards. Again, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.</P>

<P>At the last Board meeting on June 17, 1995 it was suggested that
we might consider affiliating with a national organization. If you
have any comments in regards to this just give me a call. Otherwise I
hop~ to see you all at the Annual Meeting in October.</P>

<H3>COALITION TO INCREASE MINORITY DEGREES</H3>

<P>Rosalie Graves announced that the Coalition to Increase Minority
Degrees distributed applications for funding fall 1995 projects,
which are due July 7 1995. "The CIMD is an alliance of over 75
institutions of higher education, national laboratories, professional
organizations, corporations, and organizations throughout Arizona and
New Mexico and Western Texas, Colorado and Utah. The ClMD's goal is
to increase the number of under-represented minority students who
receive baccalaureate and doctorate degrees in mathematics, the
sciences (excluding the social sciences), and engineering by funding
a variety of academic projects. The CIMD received a $5 million
five-year cooperative agreement, effective November 1, 1991, from the
National Science Foundation." There are guidelines for
faculty-directed undergraduate research projects, undergraduate peer
study groups, and AMP-NET: The Electronic Peer Study Network.</P>

<P>For further information including eligibility requirements contact
the CIMD c/o Hispanic Research Center, Box 872702, Arizona State
University, Tempe, AZ 85287-2702 or 602/965-0840.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>&gt;LET'S WELCOME OUR NEW MEMBERS</H3>

<P>We are pleased to welcome the following members to NMNWSE:</P>

<P><B>Bobbie Baca </B>of USDA Forest Service Engineering,
Albuquerque;</P>

<P><B>Elizbieta Kaleta</B>, Albuquerque;</P>

<P><B>Jan Curtis</B>, Albuquerque;</P>

<P><B>Henrietta Gatto</B>, Albuquerque;</P>

<P><B>Marci Partow</B>, Albuquerque;</P>

<P><B>Dyan Foss</B>, Albuquerque;</P>

<P><B>Diana J. Griffin, </B> Albuquerque;</P>

<P><B>Cecilia Sadler </B>, Albuquerque;</P>

<P><B>Anna M. Richards</B>, Santa Fe; and</P>

<P><B>Valerie K. Rogers</B>, Ridgecrest, CA.</P>

<H3>ELECTIONS! ELECTIONS! ELECTIONS!<BR>
by Kelli Livermore</H3>

<P>It's that time of year again: Time to renew and recharge the
NMNWSE's heart. In other words, it's time for our annual election.
This year the positions which need to be filled are:</P>

<P>* Vice President/President Elect. This position means a commitment
of three years on the Board. This individual is President Elect for
membership year October 1995 through September 1996. Then she becomes
President of the state network for membership year October
1996-September 1997. Then she serves on the Board for third year as
pastpresident. Because we rotate this position from area to area, we
particularly need a volunteer from the northern chapter for this
position. If you have questions about the position, I'm sure dede
Collins, who is finishing her year as past president, or Nancy
Stages, who is finishing her year as president, will be happy to tell
you about it. It's a great opportunity, a lot of fun, and a chance to
make a difference. Go for it!</P>

<P>* Member-at-Large. This position is a two-year commitment. Each
member-at-large is assigned a specific committee or duty for a
specific membership year. For example, I have been a member-at-large
for three years; I am in my second term. For each of those three
years my assignment has been elections. Debby Potter, the person who
has finished her last two-year term and whose position we are
filling, has been working on the newsletter for the last two years
(and what a fine job she's done, too!). The decision as to who does
what is made at the annual meeting when the new Board meets for the
first time. This person should be from either the northern chapter or
from the central chapter to keep balance on the Board.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In addition to the position, we will be asking you to vote on an
amendment to the by-laws. The Board has become aware that, to
continue maintaining balance and accomplish all tasks, we need to add
to the size of the Board. To do that we need you to approve a change
in the by-laws.</P>

<P>The ballots will be sent in August. Therefore, I need these two
individuals to volunteer by the end of July. You could also let me
know of someone to contact if she'd be good. Also, please be on the
alert for the ballots, and please participate in the election. The
by-laws amendment is particularly important, and your feedback is
necessary for us to know what to do.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>BOARD MEETINGS</H3>

<P>June 17, 1995 Notes are in preparation, but the following reports
were received at the meeting.</P>

<P><I>Standing Committee Reports.</I></P>

<P><B>Membership (Lynda Towers). </B>We have a total active
membership of 160 members in NMNWSE. We have 11 new members whose
names are listed above. We have seven members who have renewed, and
about ten corrections to the membership<B> </B>data base. The
directories have been mailed, but not yet to the new members who have
joined since the mailing.</P>

<P><B>Newsletter (Dehby Potter). </B>The next issue of the newsletter
will be the responsibility of the new Board member following
elections and the annual meeting. Debby says she has enjoyed the job,
but is looking forward to a one year reprieve from all Boards while
finishing her dissertation research.</P>

<P><B>Annual Meeting (Debby Potter). </B>The Call for Papers was
mailed to each network member and additional copies are available.
Judy Meyer, Ph.D., President of the Ecological Society of Arnerica,
had to decline the invitation to give a keynote presentation. Also,
American Airlines was unable to honor the request to donate her
round-trip ticket from Atlanta, although the University of New Mexico
would have helped pay her expenses. We discussed an alternate
speaker: the current Director of the Bureau of Mines in Washington,
D.C., Rhea Graham, a resident of NM.</P>

<P>Yolanda has drafted the meeting agenda, which incorporates
concurrent sessions, if necessary. We invited (and have a commitment
from) Coleen McNurney, biologist from the Sevilleta Wildlife Refuge,
to coordinate the tour of the refuge on Saturday afternoon. Rosalie
Graves is coordinating the ententainment, and Beulah Woodfin is
making the food arrangements. Photos of the facility are available
and show the meeting rooms, library, houses (interior and exterior
photos), grounds, etc. Debby has drafted the registration form.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>EYH and Chapter reports </B>were heard, and are included
elsewhere in the newsletter.</P>

<P>We received the following letter addressed to Nancy Stages. "Thank
you for recognizing my science fair project entitled <I>The</I>
<I>Effects of UV Light on the Chlorophyll and MAAs of Isochrysis
galbana: Phase III </I>at the New Mexico State Science and
Engineering Fair. I appreciate the effort the NM Network for Women in
Science and Engineering puts into judging and awarding projects. The
award check for $100 and certificate motivates me to continue on my
science fair project. Sincerely, <I>Diane Yaros.</I></P>

<H3>CHAPTER REPORTS</H3>

<P><I>Central (Debby Potter) -- </I>There was a Chapter meeting on
April 19 where Kelli Livermore and Kathy Kensing from Hawkwatch
International were the guest speakers.</P>

<P>Kelli presented Kree, a Swainson's Hawk/educational</P>

<P>bird, and a slide show about raptors. The next meeting is on June
21 at the home of Ellen Evans, and we are</P>

<P>inviting the essay contest and local State Science Fair<I>
</I>winners to give presentations. The last Chapter meeting this year
will be on September 20 at the home of Debby Potter.</P>

<P>Rachael has asked for relief from mailbox duty, and Debby Potter
currently holds the key and has emptied the box twice. It will
probably only be checked at most once per month, until we find
someone on Kirtland AFB or at Sandia Lab to assume this
responsibility. It was quite an ordeal to update the records at the
Post Office, which were ten years old. We were asked to <I>please
</I>fill out a new form each time the key is turned over to a new
person. Iudy Mead volunteered to take on this important job.</P>

<P><I>Southern (Vickie Reynolds) -- </I>The Southern Chapter held
meetings in April and June at the Hacienda in Las Cruces. At the lune
meeting the members discussed the potential for closing the only
emergency response rape crisis center in Las Cruces. It seems that La
Pinon Sexual Trauma Recovery and Crisis Center may have to close its
doors due to the loss of a grant from United Way. They have planned
some fund raisers in an attempt to continue providing as many of
their services as possible. The Southem Chapter will make a donation
to the Center.</P>

<P>The Chapter also sponsored <I>Take Your Daughter to Work Day </I>
at White Sands Missile Range on April 27, 1995. We started the day
with an opening session at the post theater to welcome the parents
and their daughters. Mr. George A. Orlicki, Technical Director of the
White Sands Missile Range, spoke to the participants. We distributed
some materials, including the career planning book, and presented
door prizes donated by the White Sands Missile Range Museum to all of
the children. Approximately 40 children and their parents attended
the session. Public Affairs provided media coverage to include the
local newspaper, photographers, and video. We appreciate the help
provided by the WSMR Public Affairs and EEO offices in publicizing
the event and encouraging participation.</P>

<P>The next meeting of the Southern Chapter will be held at WSMR on
July 11, 1996.</P>

<H3>EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS</H3>

<P><I>Central (Debby Potter &amp; Yolanda King)-- </I>We would like
to hold the EYH conference next year at UNM, but during spring break
in March when middle and high schools are in session. We are still
searching for a volunteer for the 1996 Chair.</P>

<P><I>Southern (Vickie Reynolds) </I>The chanter is planning the 1996
EYH conference. We are working with a representative of the local
AAUW, Janet McKimpson, who has agreed to co-sponsor next year's
conference. Discussions have covered a tentative program, facility
requirements, budget, workshop presenters, speakers, and support from
the local business community. Jane has contacted the Do&ntilde;a Ana
Community College and they have offered the use of their facilities,
which will be well suited for the conference, at no cost.</P>

<P>The date for the conference is set for Saturday February 24, 1996.
We plan to have a keynote speaker and have several possibilities in
mind. The program will consist of an opening session with the keynote
speaker, workshops, a group activity and lunch. We are hoping that
with the addition of AAUW resources we can offer a wide variety of
high quality workshops and get support from the local business
community, perhaps in the form of donations. We are excited about
having the support of AAUW and hope to make next year's conference a
truly outstanding event.</P>

<P><I>Silver City (Adnenne Dare)-- </I>No actual date has been set
for the Silver City conference but we will aim for the end of March
so as not to conflict with the Business and Professional Women's
conference at the beginning of the month. The PBW women as well as
the AAUW women want to help with the EYH conference.</P>
