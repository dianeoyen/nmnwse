         <P>I became involved in the New Mexico Network for Women in
         Science and Engineering for the same reason many of you did
         - to support the Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) conferences.
         I enthusiastically support these conferences because when I
         was a young girl I had no way of knowing all the potential
         careers that could be available for me. The EYH provides a
         glimpse of the possibilities to the young participants.</P>
         
         <P>However, as a member of the Network, I was somewhat
         skeptical of the "networking" part of the organization. You
         know, the "other" part of the Network, that was not the EYH.
         I hadn't seen much action on that score and had begun to
         think that it was wishful thinking on the part of the
         organization's founders. Then I attended the Annual Meeting
         in Las Cruces in October. I heard an exciting presentation
         by Liz Frank about a new approach to developing dot matrix
         plots to match DNA sequences. That was followed by an
         interesting lunch time talk by Mary O'Connell on the
         Bio-informatics program at New Mexico State University. Liz
         and Mary did not know each other prior to the meeting, did
         not know the other would be there, but they got together
         after lunch and began the process of getting to know each
         other and share each other's work. I watched that happen,
         and realized that networking was happening, right in front
         of my eyes. This event restored my belief in our
         organization and renewed my enthusiasm for being a part of
         it.</P>
         
         <P>With this fresh enthusiasm, I am happy to serve as the
         President this year. With your help, I hope to renew the
         enthusiasm of all of our members. Networking can't happen
         unless we get together and communicate. So let's go to the
         Chapter meetings, bring new people to Chapter meetings, and
         above all, talk with everyone, new and familiar, so that
         everyone walks away feeling welcome and valued!</P>
         
         <P>I would like to recognize the efforts of a number of
         people in the last year. First, thanks to the Southern
         Chapter, particularly Nancy Stages and Karen Saenz, for
         making the Annual Meeting happen. It was a very comfortable
         yet stimulating event. Second, a big round of applause for
         Lynda Towers, the outgoing President for her leadership and
         help during the transition. Third is a big thank you to the
         board members who continue to take on the extra curricular
         work of making the organization function. Finally, I would
         like to recognize the efforts of Judy Mead who regularly
         empties the Network mail box, sorts the mail and
         redistributes it to the Board members. Thank you one and
         all.</P>

<H2>EYH REPORTS</H2>

<P><U>Central</U> EYH Treasurer Beulah Woodfin reported that expenses
for 1997 amounted to $1127.09, and there was a net loss of $267.64.
One reason for the loss is that we had a last minute cancellation by
Sandia Labs for a donation of copying. The cost for copying material
for student and adult packets was $608.44. They therefore request
that the Board reimburse Central Chapter for $267.64.<B> </B>(see New
Business) Plans for 1998 are in progress. A planning meeting was held
on September 6. The conference is scheduled for the morning of
Saturday, March 14, 1998 at UNM and registration will be at the
Biology Department. Perennial favorite, astronaut Linda Godwin
(colleague of Chapter member Rosalie Graves), will be invited as
keynote speaker. Beulah Woodfin will continue as EYH Treasurer. Nan
Founds, Debby Potter and Leanna Minier will Co Chair the conference.
At the September Chapter meeting members helped mail brochures
announcing the date. Lynda, when can you help us generate a compute
program to match our presentations to students? The data are
currently in Excel spreadsheets. Carol, can you put our-one page,
color flyer on the web site?</P>

<P><U>Northern</U>. Carol reported that there have been no meetings
yet. The first planning meeting will be in December and the
conference will probably by in March.</P>

<P><U>Silver City</U> Adrienne reported that the Silver City
Conference is scheduled for Saturday, Feb. 21, 1998 at Western New
Mexico University. We have just begun the planning for the
conference. Prospective presenters have been contacted. For the
second year we plan to have an adult program along with the
conference for girls.</P>

<P><U>Las Cruces</U> Submitted by Karen Saenz. At our last meeting,
the Chapter decided to have the EYH conference later in the year. The
date will be April 23, 1998 at White Sands Missile Range. We also
decided to structure the day's activities differently. We can have a
max of 200 students; 25 to a group; each group will attend 4 group
activities. Teachers and high school students from Mayfield High in
Las Cruces have expressed an interest to help. The Youth Activities
Coordinator, Jim Salvador, from WSMR, also plans to help organize the
event and provide group activity leaders.</P>

<H2>CHAPTER REPORTS</H2>

<P><U>Central</U> No report. Debby Potter noted the Chapter is in
need of officers, members and volunteers to help with the Annual
Meeting.</P>

<P><U>Eastern</U> No report.</P>

<P><U>Northern</U> Submitted by Carol LaDelfe. Tinka continues to
organize lunch time talks. Election of new officers is in
progress.</P>

<P><U>Southern</U> Submitted by Karen Saenz. Chapter members agreed
to continue to hold chapter meetings in members' homes with meals
catered. I agreed(?) to continue as President and Jane Madrid agreed
to be the Vice-President. We need chapter members to volunteer to
fill the Treasurer and Secretary posts. Most business conducted was
the final preparation for the Annual Meeting in October. **Thanks
Nancy for chairing this event. Others and I appreciate your
efforts.*** Our next meeting will be 12 November. The place and
speaker are yet to be determined. The meal will be deli subs.</P>

<H2>OLD BUSINESS</H2>

<P><U>Surveying Your Future</U> Revision of the booklet is in
progress. Ann has received 17 updated articles and is expecting more.
Still looking for someone to update the article on Math. Yolanda and
Liz Ranks might know someone who would do it. Need to send them the
article.</P>

<P>Other possibilities for funding the printing of the booklet were
discussed. Yolanda will check with UNM Press and Siders will ask
Jennifer Roper to contact NM Tech since Roper mentioned they might be
interested in helping. dede will check with LANL about printing. The
booklet needs a new name since the old one is copyrighted. 'Exploring
Possibilities' was mentioned.</P>

<P><U>Mutual Funds</U> Deborah Kubicek reported that we need a
minimum of $5000 to keep the Mutual Fund open. Presently Rosalie
Graves and Barbara Torres are authorized to sign on the account. To
change the names we need a letter of instruction and copy of
corporate resolution (Non-profit Corp. report, or a copy of the
minutes should suffice). A motion to change the signatures to
Treasurer, President, and Vice-President was made by Carol, seconded
by Lynda - passed.</P>

<P><U>Dept. of Education letter</U> Debby Potter said that a member
thought this letter might be in regards to a printing bill. Lynda
still has had no response and will follow up on this.</P>

<H2>NEW BUSINESS</H2>

<P><U>Calendar</U> The Board will meet on the following dates and
places: Dec. 6th at Kelly Bitner's house in Albuquerque, Feb. 7th at
Karen Saenz's home in Alamogordo, April 4th (?) at the State Science
Fair in Socorro, June 20th at Adrienne Dare's home in Silver City,
Aug. 1st at Carol LaDelfe's home in Los Alamos and at the Annual
Meeting, Oct. 24(?).</P>

<P><U>Scholarships</U> Beulah Woodfin already held a meeting on the
scholarships discussed at the Annual Meeting and will be preparing a
proposal to submit to the board.</P>

<P><U>Mailbox</U> Judy Mead handles the mailbox. Kelly Bitner will
call Judy and thank her for all her help.</P>

<P><U>EYH Money</U> Yolanda stated that we can not afford to increase
the EYH Seed Money until after we pay for the printing of the
booklet. It was decided by the Board to keep the same amount.</P>

<P>The overrun of the Central Chapter and their request for
reimbursement was discussed at length. In the end it was decided to
pay $130 (approximately half of their loss) to the Central Chapter.
The Board was not comfortable reimbursing all of their loss because
of the expense of the printing the booklet this year. Moved by Debby,
seconded by Carol passed.</P>

<P><U>Fundraising</U> Yolanda asked the Board for ideas, foundations
that she could write to, etc. The possibility of holding a raffle was
discussed. Deborah is going to check with her quilting group to see
if they would donate a quilt for a raffle. She would like to show
them a SYF booklet so they can see what they would be working for.
Debby Potter will talk to her husband about raffling a painting.
Yolanda said she could print up the raffle tickets.</P>

<P><U>Increasing Membership</U> Board discussed briefly ways of
increasing Network membership and increasing activity of members.
Tabled to next meeting.</P>

<P><U>Awards</U> Kelly stated that she would like to have a database
of awards that we could nominate people for. Awards like the
Trailblazers, Governor's Award, YWCA, etc. Kelly will call
(1-800-432-9168) to gather more information.</P>

<H2>ANNUAL MEETING</H2>

<P>Submitted by Debby Potter. Central Chapter is hosting the annual
meeting in 1998. The preliminary date is Oct. 23-25, 1998. Debby
Potter was Chair three years ago and has materials needed for mailing
material, organizing the meeting, etc. She is willing to put together
the Program but does not want to be in charge of facilities or Chair
the meeting. Volunteers are needed, and the sooner we get started the
easier it will be to have a successful meeting. One possible meeting
place is the Sevilleta LTER (north of Socorro) like last time. Beulah
would arrange the food. A tour of the La Joya Wildlife Refuge was
suggested. Are there other suggestions? Other Board members liked the
idea of having the meeting at LTER. Debby also mentioned the
possibility of a team building exercise lead by a martial arts
instructor - the Board also liked this idea.</P>

<H2>ARCHIVES</H2>

<P>No Report</P>

<H2>ELECTIONS</H2>

<P>Submitted by Debby Potter. Carol LaDelfe from the Northern Chapter
has agreed to run for VP/President Elect in the next election.</P>

<H2>EYH</H2>

<P>Submitted by Adrienne Dare (darea@cs.wnmu.edu - new email). I have
organizational packets from the Math Science Network to distribute to
the Southern, Central and Northern Chapters. Please note there have
been some changes. There is a new Network project- Pathways: For
Young Women to Careers in Math, Science, and Engineering - an on-line
mentoring project. Let me also remind each site that the Math Science
Network wants us to send in the EYH evaluation form to them within a
month after your EYH conference. You can send these to me along with
10 copies of your brochures. As soon as the student and adult packets
arrive I will send these on to each site coordinator.</P>

<H2>FUND RAISING</H2>

<P>Report submitted by Debby Potter and Kelly Bitner for Yolanda
Jones King. For 1998 we have the following contributions so far, $500
from Allied Signal Aerospace, $500 from Phillips Petroleum Company,
$500 from Northwest and $50 from UIE. The last two were received by
Deborah Kubicek who gave the checks to Debby Potter to give to
Yolanda. A draft of-the raffle ticket was passed among the Board
members. Deborah showed two quilts that were donated by members of
her quilter's guild. One is complete and valued at $1200 while the
other will need to be finished. The Board approved of the expense to
finish the second quilt (on the order of $100). The cost of the
ticket will be $1, or 6 for $5. Other prizes include a print of a
painting by Jeff Potter, a set of luggage donated by Barbara Torres
and a throw (NM cotton weave). There will be one set of tickets and
the prizes will be ranked ' by value. The drawing will be at the
August Board meeting in Los Alamos. Tickets should be available at
the Feb. Board meeting in Alamogordo for distribution to Board
members. The Board also discussed putting the quilts on display and
rotating to the different Chapters via the Board meetings.</P>

<H2>MEMBERSHIP</H2>

<P>Submitted by Wyona Turner. There are currently 62 professional
members, 6 retired and 5 students/unemployed members for a total of
73. The membership database has been updated and no cost incurred
since the last Board meeting. There are four new members from Los
Alamos, Kathleen Mark, M. Catherine Johnson, Tamara Seebach and
Claudia Lewis. Future activities include sending out final notice
letters for renewals, prepare and print membership directory
incorporating member's primary field in membership listing by
chapter.</P>

<H2>NEWSLETTER</H2>

<P>No Report.</P>

<H2>STATE SCIENCE FAIR</H2>

<P>Kelly Bitner reported for Mercedes Agogino. The Science Fair will
be held April 18th so the April Board meeting will the 18th in
Socorro. Mercedes needs to know the categories in which we will
giving awards this year. Jennifer will determine the categories and
send the information to Mercedes. The Board suggested decreasing the
amount of money given in the junior categories so that more prizes
could be given. Savings bonds were discussed and determined to be too
much of a hassle. Kelly, Lynda, Carol, Jennifer, Debby, dede and
Mercedes have volunteered to Judge. Since we will be judging all the
categories this time we can use as many judges as we can get. If you
would like to help us judge please contact Jennifer Siders.</P>

<H2>POLICIES &AMP; PROCEDURES</H2>

<P>Lynda made the revision to the By-laws about honorary memberships.
The Board discussed making it clearer by stating that an honorary
membership was an 'annual' membership not a life time membership.
Since the new by-law was already voted on my the membership the
wording has to remain as originally stated. Changing the wording
would have to be proposed to the membership at the next annual
meeting.</P>

<H2>EYH REPORTS</H2>

<P><U>Central</U> Submitted by Debby Potter. EYH will be held March
14, 1998 at UNM. Co-Chairs Nan Founds and Debby Potter met on Oct. 13
to mail the announcement flyer to previous presenters. We have
volunteers to lead facilities (Diane Marshall), food donations (Kelly
Bitner), accept registration material (Beulah), and a third Co-Chair,
Leanna Minier of Sandia National Lab. Committees that still need a
leader include speakers and registration (on-site help and matching
students to presenters). The registration brochure has been drafted
and emailed to the conference committee for comment. It needs to be
reproduced for mailing at the January Chapter meeting. A letter
requesting presenters has been drafted and an email address list was
prepared from the UNM faculty and staff listings. Rosalie Graves will
send an invitation to astronaut Linda Goodwin for the keynote
address. Nan Founds will check whether Phillips Laboratory can pay
for her airline tickets as in the past. Otherwise we'll have to
include that fee in the budget.</P>

<P><U>Northern</U>. Carol reported that the EYH conference will be
held the week of March 23rd. Joyce Guzik and Alexine Salazar are
Co-Chairs and they are trying to bring Donna Shirley, the woman in
charge of the Mars Pathfinder project as the keynote speaker. The
first planning meeting will be in early January.</P>

<P><U>Silver City</U> Submitted by Kelly for Karen Saenz. Committee
meetings have continued as needed to plan the conference in April. We
have an agenda (day starts at 8:30am and ends at 2:15pm) and a
timetable to complete tasks. We are revising the first contact
letters to be mailed out in January. We also need to confirm the 8
group activity leaders by January 31.</P>

<P><U>Las Cruces</U> Submitted by Adrienne Dare. The Silver City EYH
Conference is scheduled for February 21, 1998 at Western New Mexico
University. We are planning for 200 girls and 100 adults. There will
be two separate conferences. This year I have additional help. Mary
Hittle is active in our AAUW Branch and is helping organize this
years conference. Mary has recruited several people. We have had some
productive planning meetings. Planning is going well. Adrienne
submitted a proposed budget for this years conference.</P>

<H2>CHAPTER REPORTS</H2>

<P><U>Central</U> Debby Potter submitted a report for Central.
Speaker for the Nov. 17th meeting was Brynda Gutierrez, Pollution
Prevention Specialist from the City of Albuquerque. The Chapter
received a $300 donation from AlliedSignal Aerospace (they also
donated $200 to Northern Chapter). The check was mailed to Deborah
Kubicek rather than deposited in the Chapter's EYH account.
Apparently au donations go to the state-wide fund. Yolanda was
concerned that the network needs to pay printing fees for the new
career booklets this year. Debby Potter sent an email message about a
$25,000 Good Housekeeping award for women in government. Cash awards
(one for $25,000, 9 for $2500) will be given. Deadline for
nominations is Dec. 15. Nominations for the Albuquerque YWCA 'Women
on the Move Award" are also due Dec. 15. Kelly Bitner and Debby
Potter have copies of the <U>announcements</U> and forms. The next
meeting (January 21) will be a working session for EYH.</P>

<P><U>Eastern</U> No report.</P>

<P><U>Northern</U> Carol LaDelfe reported that there was a Board
meeting and new officers are: President Margo Clark, Vice-President
Jennifer Siders, Secretary Cass Mason, Treasurer Ginger Young,
Membership Carol LaDelfe, Newsletter Tinka Gammel, members at large
Amy Anderson and Trish Wright. The Holiday Party will be at Jennifer
Siders on Dec. 18th.</P>

<P><U>Southern</U> Submitted by Kelly Bitner for Karen Saenz. We had
a November meeting at Nancy Stages Weinbrenner's home on Imperial
Ridge. We talked about the Annual Meeting (and how we are glad that's
over) and our EYH in April. Next committee meeting was set for Dec. 2
(which I forgot to attend!). January meeting is yet to be decided. I
have photos of the Annual Meeting for Archives. I'll have them at the
next Board meeting at my house in February.</P>

<H2>OLD BUSINESS.</H2>

<P><U>Scholarships</U>. No report. Debby Potter will contact Beulah
who was writing a proposal for the scholarships.</P>

<P><U>Awards</U>. Kelly has started making a list of awards and would
like to put it on the Network web page. Debby Potter will be
nominated by the Network for the Women on the Move award. Nominations
for some awards carry a nomination fee, like the Women on the Move
award so there was some discussion by the Board on how to pay for
such fees. Lynda will write a draft policy on nomination fees for the
next Board meeting. It was also discussed that Adrienne should also
be nominated for the Women on the Move Award. It was suggested that
completed packages - especially some of Yolanda's, since she has won
some of these awards - should be posted on the Network's web
page.</P>

<P><U>Mailbox</U>. Kelly reported that she talked to Judy Mead who is
now retired and enjoys helping with the mail. Judy needed a new list
of Board members so she could re-direct the mail to the correct
people. Kelly sent her a new list. Yolanda can get the mail as an
emergency backup. Deborah Kubicek asked if any of the Board members
had received the non-profit paperwork, nobody had so she will contact
Rachel to see if she has it or knows how to get it.</P>

<P><U>Increasing Membership</U>. Wyona will bring 'Who we are
packets' to the next Board meeting for distribution. Jenny will
provide business cards for the Network with contact information for
each Chapter. Board members should have this information with them
when selling raffle tickets.</P>

<P><U>Surveying Your Future</U>. A meeting is planned for next Friday
(Dec. 12) in Los Alamos. Some articles are in their final form, some
are in draft and Ann is still waiting to hear from some authors.</P>

<P><U>Dept. of Education letter</U>. Yolanda wants to get a letter
written to the Dept. of Education asking for confirmation that this
problem is resolved if we do not hear from them in a specified time.
Lynda will draft a letter.</P>

<P><U>Calendar</U>. Please note the change for the April Board
meeting, it will now be on April 18th in Socorro at New Mexico
Tech.</P>
