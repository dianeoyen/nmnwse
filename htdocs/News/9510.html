<H3>ANNUAL MEETING<BR>
by Debby Potter</H3>

<P>I'd like to thank the Central Chapter members who helped make this
meeting a success. Yolanda and Beulah deserve our heart-felt thanks
for organizing the technical program and making the food
arrangements, respectively. Rosalie Graves organized the
entertainment and Debby Brinkerhoff presided at the registration
table. Libby offered to prepare the Abstracts for distribution, and
jumped in to run the meetings in the absence of President Nancy
Stages. The registration form and Call for Papers for the annual
meeting and technical symposium were included in the July newsletter.
A separate mailing of the Call for Papers was made earlier. We
distributed a number of announcements at UNM Biology Department, and
all Board members were encouraged to help by distributing copies to
women outside of the network.</P>

<P>14 speakers and two workshops were arranged for the meeting and at
last count 34 women and one child arrived during the weekend of
October 20-22 at the Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research site, a
UNM research facility. The speaker/entertainment for theSaturday
evening dinner at Val Verde Steak House was Dr. Emily Neigh from New
Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. She addressed the general
topic of technical writing in her entertaining presentation entitled
<I>We're Scientists, not Poets!</I></P>

<P>The income for registration and housing fees was $1,560 received
by the October 14th deadline, plus $225 paid on-site. Three full and
one partial scholarships were requested and approved. Expenses
included payment to the LTER for housing and laundry, printing and
mailing of the Call for Abstracts, photocopying and stamps for
confirmations, film and film processing, payment to child care
provider, catererer and other food expenses to provide meals during
the meeting, and a fee for the Saturday evening speaker. Either
Yolanda or Beulah may have more expenses to claim, so I don't have a
final budget report at this time.</P>

<P>Several last-minute problems arose. (1) Rhea Graham sent a letter
canceling her address as keynote speaker due to the closure of the
U.S. Bureau of Mines. I'd like to read her compelling letter and
press release that explain the circumstances. (2) Colleen McNurney
from the Sevilleta Wildlife Refuge called to say the vans she planned
to use for our tour were no longer available. Thank goodness Yolanda
saved the day with vehicle(s) from Phillips Lab, and one Forest
Service van was available. (3) Rent-A-Granny was to provide child
care services, but did not find someone willing to travel from their
Belen office to the LTER. An ad was placed in the UNM newsletter
<I>Lobo</I>, but they managed to neglect to run the add despite three
visits to the office. Kelly Livermore's daughter Julie was able to
baby sit on Saturday and Sunday, but would be in school on Friday.
Two requests for childcare were received (one later canceled). Also
renowned ecologist Dr. Judy Meyer was originally invited to give the
keynote address, but she had to decline due to concurrent
obligations.</P>

<H3>EYH CONFERENCES</H3>

<P><B>Central Chapter (Debby Potter)</B><BR>
Our EYH Conference was held on March 4, 1995, at UNM. Yolanda gave an
outstanding performance as EYH Chair, with excellent assistance on
facilities by Diane Marshall, Nan Founds, Debby Potter, Rosalie
Graves, Debby Brinkerhoff, and all other committee members. Our
Keynote Speaker, Astronaut Dr. Linda Godwin was fantastic! About 174
students from midschool and high school attended the conference. In
addition, students from the Phillips Lab Marsville program met with
Dr. Godwin. All speakers were invited for a free dinner meeting with
the Central Chapter. We thank all of our sponsors, including
Albuquerque Public Schools, American Chemical Society, BDM
Technologies, Sunwest Bank, Sandia National Labs, IBM, PNM, Ethicon,
UIE, SAIC, Orion, EG&amp;G, ASI, USAF Phillips Laboratory, UNM, US
Department of Energy, Nobel Sysco, and Price Club.</P>

<P>The Chapter has two volunteers to Co-Chair EYH next year, Ronda
Cole and Jerry Sue Thompson. Chapter members want to consider having
EYH every two years, rather than annually.</P>

   July and that there was some discussion of a picnic.</P>
   
   <P><B>Southern Chapter</B> - A monthly meeting was held on July 11
   at the WSMR Community College. The guest speaker was Katherine
   Greyson, Executive Director of the Los Pi&ntilde;os Sexual Trauma
   Recovery and Crisis Center. She presented information to the group
   on who the victims of sexual trauma are and what the center can
   provide for them. She noted that women, are by far, not the only
   victims. Children and even adult men are all too after victims.
   She also discussed the future of the center. Due to financial
   cutbacks, her position is being eliminated so she will be
   returning to Albuquerque to continue her education. The center
   will continue to offer limited services. She also noted that the
   center is always looking for potential board members and rape
   crisis advocates.<BR>
   The chapter presented Ms. Greyson with a check for $500.00 as a
   donation to the center.<BR>
   The August monthly meeting was held at the Hacienda restaurant in
   Las Cruces on August 8. The guest speaker was Cookie Stephan,
   Director of the Women's Studies Program at New Mexico State
   University. She discussed the program which as expanded to include
   a Supplemental Major, an Undergraduate Minor and a Graduate Minor.
   This program is also suffering from financial hardship. The good
   news is that they are now a bona fide line item in the budget
   which brings a little more security. The chapter members provided
   Ms. Stephan with ideans on how she can address women in science
   and engineering specifically.</P>

Keynote Speaker, Astronaut Dr. Linda Godwin was fantastic! About 174
students from midschool and high school attended the conference. In
addition, students from the Phillips Lab Marsville program met with
Dr. Godwin. All speakers were invited for a free dinner meeting with
the Central Chapter. We thank all of our sponsors, including

<B>Northern (Karen Schultz Paige)</B></P>

<P>The accomplishments of the Northern Chapter of NMNWSE in 1995
included an increase I the membership. The word is getting out that
we are an asset to the professional, technical woman. Our goal for
next year is to continue our membership drive. We plan to do this by
having monthly activities, both social and professional, that will
draw our inactive members out and attract new members.</P>

<P>This year we had a well attended self-defense workshop led by
Rosalie Multari, a LANL postdoc who is now on our Steering Committee.
We held our Summer Picnic, which was well attended and rain-free this
year! We hosted an enjoyable EYH conference which incorporated some
of the fun team-building activities that other EYH groups in the
country have used successfully. We were also instrumental in locally
facilitating the Working Women Count! Survey sponsored by the Dept.
Of Labor. The survey forms at LANL and the response was phenomenal.
It is thrilling to help make working women's voices heard
nationwide.</P>

<P>The big event for the Northern Chapter of NMNWSE was our Annual
Meeting, held September 27th. After a quiet summer approximately 25
members had lunch together and welcomed the new board members. Our
speaker was Amy Anderson, a counselor from LANL's Employee Assistance
Group. She discussed methods to identify and manage stress and had
handouts for us to take home as resources. The new and old board
members got together on October 11th at departing president Deborah
Kubicek's house for dinner. Despite the small turnout, we were able
to decide on a number of positions for board members. The positions
filled so far include: Karen Schultz Paige, president; Wendee
Brunish, vice-president; Ginger Young, secretary; Trish Wright,
treasurer; Deborah Kubicek, membership. Our next meeting will be in
mid-November when we plan to fill the remaining positions and kick
off the new year with an EYH scheduling meeting and a brain-storming
session on next year's activities.</P>
