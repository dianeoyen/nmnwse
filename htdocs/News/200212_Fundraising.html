<h2 class="5l">December 2002 Fund-Raising
Report</h2>

<p>by Deborah Potter</p>


<p>Since the annual meeting I
have been busy compiling a list of potential funding sources and putting
together grant applications.  It&acute;s already paid off, and Intel Corporation ­
granted $4,000!  Please let me know as soon as the check arrives at the Post
Office Box so I can send the acknowledgement form for receipt of donation and a
thank-you letter to Intel.  </p>


<p>We expect to hear from New
Mexico Children&acute;s Foundation in January.  An application was transmitted
electronically to Turner Broadcasting System, but apparently denied.  I
submitted an electronic pre-proposal to Westgroup Community Partnership and am
waiting to hear if they will accept the full application.  Other applications
were prepared for later submission dates --  Paul Newman&acute;s Own and Christensen
Fund.  1,000 CD Roms were requested from Office Depot and the Southwestern
Region of IBM Corporation.  When corporate donation forms asked how their
employees can help, I said they could transfer our career book onto the CD Roms
for distribution at EYH conferences. </p>


<p>The following potential
donors were recommend by a friend who is a full-time fund-raiser for UNM.  I
plan to send solicitation letters to at least some of them.  </p>
