<P>Upcoming elections have posed a problem for us again this year.  We should be looking to the Central chapter for a candidate for Vice President-President elect, but without an active chapter in the Albuquerque area, we have had a problem in identifying a candidate.  Nancy Weinbrenner tells me that she has not been able to find a candidate from the Southern chapter either, so it looks like we'll go to the Northern chapter for the third year in a row.  I would really like to have some input from our members who live in the Albuquerque area and from those who live in eastern and southern New Mexico concerning the viability of the organization in those areas, and how we can better meet your needs.  For many of us in the north, the organization supports our members first and EYH second.  As I have observed, we do have a rather unique situation here at Los Alamos, but we will entertain any suggestions for reinvigorating chapters across the state. Are there other organizations that already provide the support that this organization once did?  What would you like to see as the future of our organization?  Please give this some thought and provide some feedback. 
<P>Thanks.

<P>Monday, April 24, 2000

<P>Lab employee to receive Governor's Award for Outstanding New Mexico Women Diane Albert of Materials Technology: Metallurgy (MST-6) has been named a recipient of a 2000 Governor's Award for Outstanding New Mexico Women.

<P>Albert was one of 30 New Mexico women honored in the 15th annual competition, sponsored by the New Mexico Commission on the Status of Women and the Governor's Office.

<P>The Commission on the Status of Women annually honors women from around the state who are actively involved in their communities, are leaders in their profession or occupation and have worked to implement positive change in their
community.

<P>Albert will be recognized at the Governor's Award for Outstanding New Mexico Women banquet May 6 in Albuquerque.  The banquet begins at 6 p.m. at the Albuquerque Crowne Plaza Pyramid. Tickets are $35 and can be purchased by calling the Commission on the Status of Women at (800) 432-9168.

<P>Albert is a previous recipient of a Governor's Outstanding Award for Women, having won in 1996. Other Lab employees have been recognized in the past as well.

<P>Albert was nominated by Juanita Salazar of the Science and Technology Base (STB) Program Office. Salazar said she brought her daughter Monica, then an
Espa&ntilde;ola Valley High School student, to the Lab for a "Take Our Children to Work Day" in 1996. Albert met Monica Salazar and has mentored her for four years.
"Diane just took her by the hand and was instrumental in getting her a job here as a summer student," said Juanita Salazar.

<P>"Ever since then I've had a great respect for her knowing that she's helped my daughter. She will always be there to help others, not only females, but any student
who wants to start a career in math or science," Salazar said, adding that her daughter is now a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania where Albert tutors
Monica Salazar in calculus using electronic mail.

<P>"I've had a really long history of mentoring, tutoring and working with young girls and encouraging them to go on to higher education," said Albert. "I want them to have the opportunity to 
talk to women about careers in science. That's why I got nominated and that's why I won. And that's what's important to me."

<P>Of the 30 women recognized annually, two are selected for induction to the New Mexico Women's Hall of Fame in September.

<P>A materials scientist in MST-6, Albert is active in the Los Alamos League of Women Voters. She also serves on the Los Alamos Chamber of Commerce
Leadership Council and the Advisory Board of the Tri-Area Association for Economic Development (TRADE) to provide an expansion of employment
opportunities and appropriate economic development in Northern New Mexico.

<P>Albert recently was awarded a $5,000 grant from The Materials Society Foundation to work with Susan Sussman, a fifth grade teacher in Los Alamos, to develop
materials science experiments for elementary school students.
<P>Albert donates her grant-proposal writing skills to the Pojoaque Girls Soccer Boosters and the New Beginnings program at University of New Mexico, Los Alamos.
She also volunteers at the Los Alamos Family YMCA as a personal trainer, fitness specialist and indoor cycle instructor.

<P>Albert is vice chairperson of the Los Alamos County Transportation Board and also chairs its Bicycle Subcommittee. She serves on the Board of Trustees of the
Friends of Bandelier National Monument and the National Council of the National Parks and Conservation Association.

<P>"I am very active in the areas of mentoring and education, protecting the environment and empowerment through political activism and economic self-sufficiency,"
said Albert.

<P>Albert has a bachelor's degree in metallurgical engineering from Ohio State University and a doctoral degree in metallurgical engineering and materials science from
Carnegie Mellon University. Albert has worked at the Lab since 1993.
