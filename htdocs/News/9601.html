         <H2>PRESIDENTS MESSAGE</H2>
         
         <P>Happy New Year!</P>
         
         <P>Each season brings a new perspective to me on life and
         the world. At the new year I see a clean slate ready for new
         challenges, new goals, and new activities. It's an exciting
         time both personally and for the Network.</P>
         
         <P>This year's Expanding Your Horizons conferences are just
         around the corner. Plans for each area's activities were
         presented at December's Board Meeting and are being
         discussed in each chapter's meetings. I am so excited to be
         able to attend all the conferences because this is our
         primary reason for existence -- to encourage young women to
         pursue careers in math and science.</P>
         
         <P>I'd like to let you know a little more about me. I've
         been a member of the Network for four years. For the first
         year I watched and learned. The second two years I was
         membership Chairman. Last year I accepted the three year
         responsibility of leadership, serving the first year as
         Vice-President/President-Elect, this year as President, and
         next year will be Past President.</P>
         
         <P>For the past eight years I have worked for BDM. I am
         currently working in the Education Technologies group. We
         provide technical services support to school districts that
         are implementing programs to use technology in both their
         business and instructional areas. It is rewarding work and I
         am pleased to have been able to make the transition from
         defense work to the education area.</P>
         
         <P>I'm looking forward to getting to know many of you better
         this year. When I served the Network in the capacity of
         Membership Chairman for two years, many names became
         familiar. I'm always delighted when I can meet the person
         that goes with the name and learn more about other women
         with similar goals.</P>
         
         <P>Best wishes to each of you in this new year and heartfelt
         thanks for all the work you have done to support young women
         throughout the state in choosing technical careers.</P>
         
         <P>Fondly, Libby</P>

<H2><A NAME=RTFToC1></A>BOARD MEETING </H2>

<P><IMG SRC="gavel.gif" WIDTH=98 HEIGHT=54 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom>
December 9, 1995.</P>

<P>The meeting was held at the home of Lori Laplanche in Las Cruces
and chaired by President Libby Haas . The following Board members
were present: Mercedes Agogino, dede Collins, Adrienne Dare, Libby
Haas, Yolanda Jones King, Carol LaDelfe, Ellen Overton, Debby Potter,
Nancy Stages and Lynda Towers. Proxies for Kelli Livermore and
Rachael Pitts. The minutes from the June meeting were reviewed,
amended and unanimously approved.</P>

<H2><A NAME=RTFToC3></A>CHAPTER REPORTS </H2>

<H4>Central Chapter</H4>

<P>The Chapter met at the home of Jerry Sue Thompson on November 15.
The speaker was Randi Buck of the Regional Science Fair. She provided
information on the science and mentor program, and asked for any
volunteers. The next meeting will be held January 17 at the home of
Rosalie Graves. Information packets for the Expanding Your Horizons
(EYH) conference will b prepared for mailing.</P>

<P>The Central Chapter will be providing prizes for the Regional
Science Fair. The prizes will go to the best engineering or science
project in both the junior and Senior levels. The prizes will be
$100.00 savings bonds. We will also seek volunteers from within the
Chapter to be Science Fair judges.</P>

<P>Plans for Central Chapter EYH have started. Jerry Sue Thompson and
Rhonda Cole are co-chairs. It will be held March 9 at University of
New Mexico. The first meeting of the EYH Steering Committee will be
held on December 6.</P>

<H4>Northern Chapter</H4>

<P>The Northern Chapter Board has met once since the Annual Meeting.
This meeting was an orientation session for some of our new members.
Many of them have willingly jumped into organizing our various
activities. We discussed setting up a new membership status for
people receiving chapter information only. This membership would be
used to keep upper management personnel at LANL informed of our
activities but would not give them full membership status. This issue
is still under discussion. We also have organized our next membership
activity which is scheduled for December 15. This will be our first
annual holiday stress-busting on-site chair massage session. We have
hired two masseuses (female massage experts) to come to LANL at the
lunch hour and members can pay for fifteen minute massage sessions.
We think it will be well attended. Our next board meeting is December
12.</P>

<H4>Southern Chapter</H4>

<P>The Southern Chapter elected new officers: President Mary Bochman
and Vice President Vickie Reynolds. Jane Madrid and Amber Hittle
agreed to continue as Secretary and Treasurer, respectively.</P>

<P>FUTURE PLANS</P>

<P>The database will be transferred and updated before next board
meeting.</P>

<P>A letter will be sent to the members who have not renewed their
memberships by 1 January in early January. Those members who do not
remit their dues within 30 days will be dropped.</P>

<H4><A NAME=RTFToC7></A>Fundraising (Yolanda Jones King). </H4>

<P>Approximately sixty (60) fundraising letters were sent out to
community science and engineering firms and local educational and
charitable foundations in the middle of November. Several other
companies have been gathered using NM Business Journal and similar
publications. These will be sent out before mid-December.</P>

<P>US West Foundation was contacted to determine if they were still
going to donate the $500 for EYH. They are going to cut the check on
or about December 8th and put it in the mail around then including a
camera ready logo to use in our brochures and/or publicity. They
apologized for any confusion, but they didn't realize we needed it
this soon (I guess).</P>

<P>The USAF Phillips Laboratory's educational outreach will most
likely sponsor the folders for the EYH. Paperwork is being processed.
However, still no definite word on the DOE and/or SNL covering the
booklets. However, until the copyright issue is taken care of we have
a moot issue. The revised copy is needed before we can go to
press.</P>

<P>REMINDERS:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Let me know of your local fundraising</LI>
   
   <LI>PLEASE let people know who our sponsors are and name them in
   your brochures, advertising, etc. It helps to get money
   later.</LI>

</PRE>

<P>The organizational packet has been received from the Math/Science
network. Copies have been mailed to Shirley Herrera and Jerry Sue
Thompson. A packet has been hand carried to Las Cruces for Vickie
Reynolds.</P>

<P>The Student and Adult packets should be here any day. I will
distribute copies as soon as I receive them from the Math/Science
network.</P>

<P>Karen Schultz Paige checked with dede Collins to see if there were
any problem concerning the copyright protection on SURVEYING YOUR
FUTURE since we have modified the document. Dede talked with the
original author. There appears to be no problem.</P>

<P>The decision about the printing of the folders and the SURVEYING
YOUR FUTURE booklets will need to be made very soon since the first
of our conferences in 1996 will be at the end of February.</P>

<H4>Central Chapter</H4>

<P>- The Central Chapter has EYH plans underway and presented a
budget to the board.</P>

<P><B>Northern Chapter -</B> We held an EYH kickoff meeting on
December 5, at lunch. Five people attended the meeting. Since most of
them had worked on the EYH conference before, we set to work
assigning people to specific chair positions. Our EYH conference this
year will be on Wednesday, March 20. The EYH co-chairs are Shirley
Herrera (last year's EYH chair) and Joyce Guzik. The chair for EYH
treasurer will be Trish Wright. The chair for registration will be
Carol LaDelfe. The chair for workshop presenters will be Karen
Schultz Paige. The chair for contacting schools will be Ann Mauzy.
Nancy Scheer will be our liaison to AAUW who will be contacting the
Santa Fe schools for us. The most pressing issues to be dealt with
include contacting professional associations for career literature,
brainstorming team building activities for the girls, reserving rooms
and facilities needed, and recruiting presenters. We are working on
all of these issues. Our next EYH meting will be in early
January.</P>

<H4>Southern Chapter</H4>

<P>Interim Report - December 15, 1995.</P>

<P>Target audience is mid school age girls. Vista, Lynn, and Sierra
Middle Schools were personally visited by AAUW members Janet
McKimpson and Beverly Stiles. Zia, Pacacho, and White Sands Middle
Range schools were visited by Ms McKimpson, Ms Stiles, and Vickie
Reynolds (NMNWSE). Schools outside of the immediate Las Cruces area
were contacted by letter. They are Chaparral, Community Christian,
Holloman Air Force Base (Alamogordo), (Gadsden (Anthony), Capitan,
Carrizozo, Chaparral, Cloudcroft, Hatch Valley, Ruidoso, Santa
Teresa, and Truth or Consequences. Plans are to meet with the Las
Cruces Hispano Chamber of Commerce in January 1996.</P>

<P>By drawing from the AAUW membership, workshop choices have been
expanded beyond the traditional math, science and engineering choices
this year. Since each girl will attend three workshops, they will all
still get a "dose" of math, science and/or engineering.</P>

<P>Keynote speaker is Susanna Martinez. She is a local attorney and
candidate for District Attorney in Las Cruces. Ms Martinez is an
entertaining speaker and is an admirable role model, especially for
the many young Hispanic girls who attend our conferences.</P>

<H4>Silver City</H4>

<P>The Silver City EYH will be held on the Western New Mexico
University campus. The BPW (Business and Professional Women)
organization and PEO will be joining AAUW in helping sponsor the
event. Planning is still in the early stages. Our major expenses will
be lunch and T-shirts. We expect to be able to raise more money from
the local community this year. I am still considering doing some sort
of adult program but haven't made any definite decisions.</P>
