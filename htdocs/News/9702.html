         <P>Greetings to all you wonderful members!<BR>
         First, I like to encourage and commend each Chapter for the
         wonderful planning and preparation going into the upcoming
         EYH activities. The Southern Chapter has already finished
         their EYH in early February. The reports received at the
         last NMNWSE board meeting are it was very successful.<BR>
         In a January/February, 1997, ExecutiveFemale article written
         by Jon Entine and Martha Nichois headlines stated:</P>
         
         <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Good Leadership: What's Its Gender?</B><BR>
            "Some say women are born to nurture; other insist we're
            better leaders than men ever dreamed of being. The truth
            lies somewhere in between, where people are individuals
            and gender, like race and ethnicity, is a highly
            unreliable guide to real-world behavior."<BR>
            Since the 70s, women have been climbing the corporate
            ladder, often becoming high-visibility role models for a
            new style of "feminine" management. More recently,
            everyone from feminist academics to the mainstream press
            has celebrated a surge in what is thought of as female
            ways of leadership, particularly among charismatic
            entrepreneurs like Roddick and Donna Karan.<BR>
            According to popular myth, women entrepreneurs lead their
            companies differently from the way the typical business
            guy does. And women managers empower and nurture
            employees, establish more egalitarian relationships and
            substitute web like corporate structure for the
            traditional command-and-control reporting hierarchies.
            Compassion, according to this belief, gets equal billing
            with competition.<BR>
            This new fascination with female management is not just a
            woman thing. Male executives, too-especially "new age"
            ones like Tom Chappell of Tom's of Maine, Howard Schultz
            of Starbucks and Ben Cohen of Ben &amp; Jerry's-promote
            their companies as bastions of compassion, icons of
            socially responsible business and models of a gentler,
            more embracing form of capitalism. Even some of the most
            prominent corporate men-such as "neutron" Jack Welch of
            General Electric-have flourished in part because they
            balance traditional values with stereo typically feminine
            one.<BR>
            Now that women have begun to garner power, filling nearly
            half of all managerial positions by some counts, many
            don't opt for the feminine, nurturing model. In fact most
            successful executives (of either gender) demonstrate a
            blend of several different styles. Take Carol Bartz of
            Autodesk, Inc., who was hyped, by the business press as a
            "feminine" leader when she became CEO in 1992. The former
            VP at Sun Microsystems was hailed as a team builder with
            a women's torch who could successfully reorganize the
            faltering California software company. The success that
            was predicted has come to pass.<BR>
            Neither men nor women have a lock on integrity, nor on
            the ability to inspire a team, develop good personal
            relationships and establish a flexible and accountable
            corporate structure-the diverse qualities all executive
            will need to make business thrive in the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
         
         <P>In summary, It is stated that good leadership does not so
         much depend on gender but on the style you use to lead
         employees. In the current team environment, I believe that
         means encouraging participation, share power and
         information, enhance other people's self worth and get other
         excited about their work.<BR>
         As each chapter prepares for their EYH activities, may we
         make a difference in the life of the girls who will attend
         EYH and in the lives of fellow employees! Looking forward to
         attending many of the EYH activities and getting to know
         each of you better.<BR>
         Keep up the good work and thank you!</P>

<H2>FUNDRAISING</H2>

<P>The mailing database was updated as was the fundraising letter.
About 75 companies have been mailed to as of this date. A thank you
letter was sent to AlliedSignal for the $500 they had sent to us. I
sent a thank you to Marilyn Morgan through whom the donation was
pushed as an employee of AlliedSignal. Marilyn has been a member of
the NMNWSE. I have had a few additional suggestions of companies and
I will mail to them before the end of the year. We have just received
a $1000 pledge from INTEL.</P>

<P>The proposals can still not be accomplished in that there are many
members of the Board who have not sent me their information. I will
proceed when I get most of them; however, four (4) <I>doesn't
</I>quite present a very cooperative picture. Thanks to those who
were so prompt.</P>

<P>Please tell your EYH chair to put all of the statewide sponsors in
their brochures. I usually give credit to the previous year, since we
are out of sync to give them credit in the year they give. See last
report and newsletter for the names from last year, plus make sure
your add AlliedSignal. Remember to report local sponsors to me as
well.</P>

<P>If your employer has a donation program for organizations to which
their employee belong, please request funding for EYH. Also let me
know when you put in the request. If you need help with needed
information, I'm glad to assist.</P>

<H2>ARCHIVES</H2>

<P>The 11 boxes of information given to the NMNWSE Archives from Joe
Fritz, Georgia's husband, have been processed by dede Collins, '96
Archivist. It is now 3 and a half boxes of which only a half a box is
NMNWSE information. The other three are all Los Alamos WIS. dede
plans to give the 3 boxes to the Los Alamos Historical Society. dede
is sure that there is more NMNWSE stuff that may be coming from Joe.
She will just keep the stuff (half box) and pass it on to next
Archivist. There is very little information other than what she has
collected on NMNWSE. If anyone has any Newsletters or Board Meeting
Minutes or Annual Meeting Information or EYH Information from
previous years let dede know so she can put together into a complete
set.</P>

<H2>POLICIES and PROCEDURES</H2>

<P>dede Collins handed out new copies of the <U>Bylaws</U> and
<U>Policies and Procedures</U>. dede reported one change in the
<U>Bylaws</U> that was passed at the Taos Annual Meeting; The change
in the Annual Audit Committee from 3 to 2.</P>

<P>The Board reviewed the updated <U>Policies and Procedures</U>.
Some changes were made. dede will bring final copies to everyone for
their notebooks next meeting.</P>

<H2>EYH</H2>

<H3>State, Adrienne Dare</H3>

<P>The organizational material for the EYH conferences should be
mailed to me next week by the Math Science Network. The student and
adult packets should follow soon. As soon as I receive the materials
I will forward them to the contact person at each site.</P>

<P>Yolanda will be bringing the EYH Folders for distribution at the
board meeting.</P>

<P>I'd like to verify the contacts, dates and the numbers expected.

<H3>Central Chapter, Debby Potter</H3>

<P>The Chapter has tentative plans to hold an EYH Conference at UNM
in March. Nan Founds is Co-Chair, and we are seeking a second
Co-Chair. Beulah Woodfin will organize registration and Diane
Marshall will make arrangements for facilities. Ronda Cole will
interface with APS. The potential keynote speaker is Ann Pizzorusso,
VP for Environmental Affairs for Philips North America, a Dutch
electronics group. Ann has combined her talents as geologist and
artist to determine that one work in the British Museum attributed to
DaVinci may be the work of another artist. We will emphasize more
"hands-on" workshops. The Federal Women's Program is being asked to
participate. To date, no organizing meetings are planned prior to the
next bimonthly meeting in January.</P>

<H3>Silver City, Adrienne Dare</H3>

<P>The conference is scheduled for Saturday, February 22, 1997 at
Western New Mexico University. We have begun the planning for the
conference. We are planning for 150 girls. For the first time we will
try an adult program for 50 adults. Presenters are being contacted
and committees are being formed.</P>

<H3>Southern Chapter</H3>

<P>We are completing the final planning stages of the Conference. We
have 9 confirmed workshops and are contacting presenters for 6 more.
We are also working on approximately 6 White Sands Missile Range
(WSMR) site tours. The conference will be held on 6 February 1997 at
WSMR.</P>

<H3>Central Chapter</H3>

<P>The Central Chapter met on November 20 at Kelly Bitner's home. The
speaker was Dr. Donna Cowell Senft who discussed her involvement in
improving the reliability of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems at
Sandia National Laboratory. The next meeting will be held January 15
at the home of Rosalie Graves. The January meeting is traditionally
used to prepare mail packets for EYH, so we'll need lots of help!
Debby Brinkerhoff has volunteered to serve as President of the
Central Chapter for FY 1997. Judy Hendricks has agreed to be the
representative to the Board for the Central Chapter. Debby Potter
will carry proxy votes for Kelly Bitner and Judy Hendricks at the
December Board meeting. The Chapter responded to the Regional Science
Fair with a commitment to sponsor awards in several categories in
1997.</P>

<H3>Eastern Chapter (Mercedes Agogino)</H3>

<P>ENMU Women in Science group has held 2 meetings this fall. Kari
Bernard, a student member, attended the Annual meeting and expressed
interest in having a Portales EYH.</P>

<H3>Northern Chapter</H3>

<P>Northern: We are currently planning our Holiday activities. In a
Board meeting on Nov. 19th, Tinka Gammel agreed to host our annual
holiday party at her house on the evening of Dec. 12th. Food and
refreshments will be served and door prizes will be given out. We use
this event as a membership drive and have posted flyers in public
areas to encourage attendance.</P>

<P>Tentative plans for 1997 include an EYH planning meeting in early
January, as well as lunch time gatherings for our members. We are
currently trying to establish an open lunch date, say the first
Monday of each month, when members can just meet in the LANL
cafeteria and have lunch together. We will see how well this concept
works. In addition, we are trying to line up lunch time seminar
speakers, include a trainer who would talk to us about improving our
talks and presentations, and possibly have a archeologist talk about
some of the petroglyphs and other archeological features in Northern
New Mexico. These talks will take place in early 1997, before the big
push leading to EYH begins.</P>

<H3>Southern Chapter (Mary Bochmann)</H3>

<CENTER>We are having EYH committee meetings to finalize the
Conference, and Chapter meetings every other month The next Chapter
meeting will be on January 15 1997 at Jane Madrid's home, 4024
Tamarisk, Las Cruces, at 6:30 p.m. We plan to have dinner catered and
then hold the Business Meeting. The Chapter will try an every other
month Chapter Meeting and committee meetings as needed to attempt to
increase members and interest.

<H2>ELECTIONS</H2>

<P>Debby Potter made a few additions to the Elections notebook, i.e.,
a sample ballot and chronology of ballot positions elected since
1994. She also drafted the ballot for August 1997, without specifying
names of the nominees. Karen Saenz is seriously considering the
position of President-elect which needs to come from the Southern
Chapter. In addition 3 At-Large Members are up for either re-election
or replacement (Yolanda Jones King, Carol La Delfe, and dede
Collins). We will also elect a Secretary in the event Jennifer

<H3>Future Activities</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Produce and mail membership directories by
end of February. Enclose welcome letters with directories to all new
members. Is there a need to make more membership brochures?
Revise?</FONT></P>

<H2>FUNDRAISING</H2>

<P>About 100 companies have been mailed to as of this date. Thank you
letters have been sent to UIE ($300), PNM ($250), Bradbury &amp;
Stamm ($250), Applied Research Associates ($100), Ethicon ($250) and
AlliedSignal ($500). Intel will be thanked as soon as we receive
their check ($1000). Cobre Mining and Norwest ($500) will be thanked
as soon as the amount is determined. The total to date (with pledge)
is $2900.</P>

<P>The proposals will be accomplished even though there are some
members of the Board who have not sent me their information. I
obtained some write-ups from the Elections notebook in order to have
a near-complete set. Let's hope we do well. I need the statistics
from last year's EYHs: attendance by grades, sex and minorities. The
summary of surveys would be useful as well as a copy of each budget.
They need a total project cost estimate. I need a copy of the last
audit form as well.</P>

<P><B>PLEASE tell your EYH chair to put all of the statewide sponsors
in their brochures. </B>I usually give credit to the previous year,
since we are usually out of sync to give them credit in the year they
give. Adrienne has a copy of the donors as well. <B>Remember to
report local sponsors to me.</B></P>

<P>On the EYH folders: Phillips Lab did not put it in the FY97
budget. I have requested that it go into the FY98 budget to get
printed early this Fall for the l 998 EYHs.</P>

<H2>ARCHIVES</H2>

<P>dede Collins again asked if anyone has any Newsletters or Board
Meeting Minutes or Annual Meeting Information or EYH Information from
previous years as some information is missing and she would like to
bring the archives up to date.</P>

<H2>POLICIES and PROCEDURES</H2>

<P>dede Collins handed out copies of the <U>Bylaws</U> and Policies
and Procedures. The Board reviewed the updated <U>Policies and
Procedures</U>. Some errors were found and corrections were
indicated. dede will bring corrected copies to everyone for their
notebooks next meeting.</P>

<H2>EYH</H2>

<H3>State, Adrienne Dare</H3>

<P>Report not available</P>

<H3>Central Chapter, Debby Potter</H3>

<P>We're making steady progress on our March 15 EYH conference at
UNM. Co-Chairs are Nan Founds and Debby Potter. The Steering
Committee also includes Diane Marshall, Beulah Woodfin, Yolanda Jones
King, Kelly Bitner, Debby Brinkerhoff, Ronda Cole, Ellen Evans, Judy
Hendricks, Donna Senft, Mary Ann Sweeney, and Jerry Sue Thompson.
Speakers' forms were mailed after an EYH meeting at Nan's house on
January 26, with replies requested by Feb. 10. Responses are starting
to be received, but please, CHAPTER MEMBERS WE STILL NEED YOUR HELP!
There were problems getting printing by Sandia Labs this year, so the
Forest Service donated printing of 2,000 brochures and 200 color
flyers. The steering committee met at the home of Debby Brinkerhoff
on February 1 to package the brochures and flyers for distribution.
These were mailed to all public and private middle schools and high
schools and to neighboring pueblos. Ronda Cole hand-delivered all
materials for APS. We'll probably need to meet after the registration
deadline of Feb. 24th to match speakers to presenters. Three weeks
before EYH, Judy Hendricks and Jerry Sue Thompson will lead a
"How-To" session for all presenters.</P>

<P>The Co-Chairs are adding to the existing notebook and software
repository for EYH. Some critical pieces seemed to be missing from
past years, but we hope to have a complete package to turn over to
the next Chairs. This will include a check-list of tasks with
recommended timeline and a list of who led each task this year (see
attachments).</P>

<P>We also have a letter inviting President Lynda Towers to provide
welcoming remarks. Copies of EYH materials were passed-around for
viewing.</P>

<H3>Northern Chapter, Joyce Guzik</H3>

<P>We are off to a good start preparing for our Expanding Your
Horizons conference to be held Thursday, March 20, at the J. Robert
Oppenheimer Study Center at LANL. This year's EYH committee co-chairs
are Joyce Guzik and Shirley Herrera. Our committee chairs are:</P>

<P>Workshop Presenters: Karen Schultz Paige and Wendee Brunish<BR>
Treasurer: Trish Wright<BR>
Recruiting: Ann Mauzy and Tinka Gammel<BR>
Registration: Carol Ladelfe<BR>
Programs: Deborah Kubicek<BR>
Team Activity: Deborah Kubicek and Ginger Young<BR>
Fund Raising: Diane Albert<BR>
Facilities and Refreshments: Shirley Herrera</P>

<P>We already have donations from X and T division at the lab, the
American Vacuum Society, and AAUW. We have at least 6 confirmed
workshop presenters. For our team activity we are planning an "egg
drop". We are also planning two adult workshops/presentations by the
Bradbury Science Museum and the American Vacuum Society. Veterinarian
Kathleen Ramsey will be our guest speaker.</P>

<P>A change from last year is that we decided to provide lunch
on-site to the participants, as well as healthier refreshments.</P>

<P>This week Joyce Guzik and Gloria Cordova were interviewed for the
LANL publication Reflections. The March issue will highlight women's
history month, and include some pictures of past EYH conferences.</P>

<H3>Silver City, Adrienne Dare</H3>

<P>The Silver City EYH is scheduled for Saturday Feb. 22 on the WNMU
campus. After the opening session the girls will attend two morning
workshops. After lunch there will be one more workshop plus a group
activity in the gym. Our goal is to reach 150 middle school and high
school girls. At the conclusion of the day the girls will receive
T-shirts. Twelve women from the community in technical positions will
provide the hands on workshops.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In addition, this year we are doing an adult
program for parents and teachers. We plan for 50 adults. In the
morning there will be a panel of middle school girls who will discuss
with the adults an AAUW video "Girls in the Middle" which address
issues of concern to middle school girls. After lunch, "Girls Can",
another AAUW video and discussion will address some of the gender
issues that produce barriers for girls. Financial information for
colleges and career information will also be provided. The adult
program is designed to aid adults in playing a more constructive role
in helping girls succeed.</FONT></P>

<H3>Southern Chapter</H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The EYH conference was held on 6 February.
We had approximately 170 students (6th, 7th, and 8th grade) and 40
adults. We had a total of 13 workshops and 6 tours. Each student
attended 2 workshops, 1 tour and a group activity. The evaluations,
at a quick glance, were very positive, had some good suggestions for
next year, and were typical for students that age ("interesting, but
boring"). The evaluations will be rated at the next EYH Working
Meeting and at our next regular Chapter Meeting. As usual, we learned
a lot, had fun, and are glad it is over. The clean up stuff, such as
Thank You letters, lessons learned discussions, and storage of
supplies, still remain to be done.</FONT></P>

<H3>Central Chapter</H3>

<P>Debby Brinkerhoff graciously offered to serve the Chapter as both
President and Treasurer. The Chapter met on January 15 at the home of
Rosalie Graves for a working meeting for Expanding Your Horizons.
Because printed materials were not ready, we discussed progress to
date and planned future tasks. Work planned for the January Chapter
meeting was deferred to the EYH steering committee meeting of January
26. The next Chapter meeting will be after EYH, on Wednesday April
16, 1997, at the home of Libby Haas (6 PM).</P>

<H3>Eastern Chapter</H3>

<P>Report unavailable.</P>

<H3>Northern Chapter</H3>

<P>The Northern Chapter is planning a luncheon meeting for members
February 18th. The speaker will be Bev Larsen, a LANL archeologist.
She will be speaking on archeological sites around the lab. We hope
that the brown-bag luncheon is well attended.</P>

<P>In other chapter news, we recently "discovered" an old savings
account that we had not been using. Those funds have been transferred
to our new accounts and will help out with EYH expenses.</P>

<P>LAWIS members helped out as judges for Los Alamos School's Science
Fair on Feb. 7th. The awards were gift certificates from Ottowi
bookstore with the values of $25, $15, $10.</P>

<P>The Northern Chapter board has chosen Carol Ladelfe to replace
Karen Schultz Paige as president of the chapter. Karen's term as
president will end February 28th. Because of EYH activities, the
Northern chapter board will not be holding any more meetings until
after the EYH activities end, probably sometime in April. Carol will
be responsible for these meetings until the end of the LAWIS calendar
year. A replacement member is currently being sought to fill Karen's
position on the board. The term of this open position is the end of
the LAWIS calendar year.</P>

<P>Our next scheduled newsletter is Feb 18. The deadline for all
articles is Feb. 14. Tinka Gammel is the newsletter editor for the
chapter.</P>

<H3>Southern Chapter</H3>

<P>Our chapter met 15 January 1997, at Jan Madrid's home with 6
members and 2 guests attending. We discussed the upcoming EYH
conference and finalized the details. We also viewed the "Techno
Success: Careers for the 21st Century" 15 minute video. The response
to the meeting at a member's home was very positive. We all had a
chance to visit, network, and hold the Business meeting. Separate
committee working meetings helped keep the business portion of the
Chapter meetings short and informative.</P>

<P>The Chapter is participating in the Gadsden School Career Day on 7
February 1997. Two of our members, Mary Bochmann and Ruth French,
will be attending. They have extra materials from the EYH conference
to hand out and a video about career choices "Techno Success: Careers
for the 21st Century" to view.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Our next Chapter meeting will be 4 March
1997, at Kay Fleming's, 3112 Executive Hills, Las Cruces, NM, at 6PM.
Our speaker will be Ann Carlson on the "Baby Think It Over Program".
The meal will be free.</FONT></P>

<B>OUTREACH OUTREACH OUTREACH<BR>
DID YOU EVER ASPIRE TO BE A POLITICIAN?<BR>
DO YOU THINK YOU HATE POLITICS?<BR>
HAVE WE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU</B></CENTER>

<P>Come and explore Washington DC through the Legislative Affairs
Staff Congressional Fellowship Program. This unique program provides
the opportunity to see Congress up close and personally. Vacancy
Announcement WO-250-97 can take you to a whole new world.</P>

<P>The person selected for this position gets an expense paid move to
Washington and the chance to compete for selection as an American
Political Science Association (APSA) Congressional Fellow. That honor
- it is! - comes with a wonderful orientation to the processes and
players of the 105th Congress. Join political scientists; medical,
media, and education professionals; fellow government employees from
domestic and foreign affairs programs as you learn about our
political system. Noted Political Scientists that you watch on TV
share their views; Members of Congress share their experiences and
expectations; Hill Staff tell you about their world and the costs and
benefits of the Hill lifestyle; and the Congressional Research
Service provides you training on Congress, from how offices are
organized to how the Committee system works. Seminars throughout the
year include topical issues, orientation to the Supreme Court, and an
international exchange program. Following the orientation you will
begin your job search on the Hill. Work assignments can be found in
personal or committee offices in both Chambers of Congress.</P>

<P>Once you get a Hill assignment the Forest Service pays your salary
and you are a "Hill Staffer" for up to 9 months. APSA encourages
Fellows to switch offices and get exposure to both the House of
Representatives and Senate. You serve Members of Congress and see the
truth behind the newspaper articles. Its a fascinating experience and
- for some the best part is - you know when it is going to end!</P>

<P>For those of you that love politics, you can see how the "big
guns" play. For those of you that hate politics, you can test your
skills and endurance. Who knows, you might even like it! When you
finish your stint on the Hill a warm chair awaits you on the
Legislative Affairs Staff in the WO.</P>

<P>LIFE IN DC?!? Think you won't like it? Think again.... There are
tons of things to do and see. Housing is available, though you may go
through a bit of a shock at costs. Tradeoffs have to be made but
rural and suburban lifestyles can be found. Don't write us off. This
vacancy is, in many ways, a chance of lifetime. Former fellows all
think it a "significant" life event. Do you need one?!?</P>

<P>Consider putting in for WO-250-97. If you have questions about the
Staff or the Fellowship program you can contact the most recent
Fellows to see what its all about:</P>
