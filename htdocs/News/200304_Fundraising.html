<h2>April 2003 EYH Fund-Raising
Report</h2>

<p>by Deborah Potter, Vice
President / President-Elect NMNWSE</p>


<p>I still have
not received all of the biosketches that were requested from each Board member.
 I&acute;m missing ones from dede, Jeanne, Alexine, Kelly, Dana, Mercedes, Mary and
Catherine.  Without the information, we will be ineligible for certain grants. 
<b>Please send them ASAP to <a href="mailto:ulinski@unm.edu">ulinski@unm.edu</a></b></p>


<p>The Articles of Incorporation
were mailed to the Attorney General&acute;s Office, Registrar of Charitable
Organizations, on February 20<sup>th</sup>.  That should complete the Network&acute;s
paperwork.  Registration was required by LANL Foundation and McCune Foundation.</p>


<p>We received a $200 check from
Applied Research Associates.  Total money raised since October is $5,500 for
2003 and an expected award of $15,000 for subsequent years. Since the last
meeting, thank-you letters for donations were mailed to LANL Foundation, United
International Engineering, Inc., Applied Research Associates and Office Depot. 
With the $200 purchase card I bought 800 writeable CD Roms and quarter labels.
There was not enough money on the card to buy the jackets, and they were
expensive.  Perhaps we can buy them later for a better price or get another
donation. <b>Who should receive the purchases to copy the career booklets?</b></p>


<p>Grant applications were
mailed to Newman&acute;s Own, Sandia Foundation, NM Women&acute;s Foundation and PNM.
Letters of regret were received from New Mexico Children&acute;s Foundation, The Ford
Foundation and Burlington Northern.<b>  How can we reconstruct a list of past
donors?</b>  That information is also
requested on some grant applications.</p>


<p>Central Chapter has raised
questions about the definition of an EYH sponsor.  I noted that all cash donors
(state-wide and Chapter contributions) should be listed as sponsors, plus
organizations that provide materials such as folders. Some people wanted every
woman&acute;s work affiliation listed (speakers, tour leaders, planning committee,
etc.) including specific Departments and branches of UNM.  It seems appropriate
that affiliations for women on the EYH Planning Committee are routinely listed
(although they are not necessarily sponsors), but I do not recommend that the
affiliation of all conference participants be listed.  <b>Let&acute;s discuss the
definition of EYH sponsor for consistency and Board policy.</b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>  <b>Do any employers have written agreements with the
Network to receive recognition for EYH participation by their employees?</b></p>
