         <P>LANL retiree Georgia Fritz died June 26 following a fall
         while hiking in the Jemez Mountains.</P>
         
         <P>A chemist, Fritz joined the Laboratory in 1962 in the
         Health Research Laboratory. She transferred into Explosives
         Technology in 1975 and moved to Waste Management in 1988.
         She retired in 1991 and later worked as a Laboratory
         associate in Analytical Chemistry.</P>
         
         <P>Fritz was co-founder of both Los Alamos Women in Science
         and the Northern New Mexico chapter of the Mexico Network
         for Women in Science and Engineering. Both of these groups
         (now merged into the LAWIS-Northern Chapter of NMNWSE)
         encourage women to choose science careers. She also was
         active in the American Chemical Society, the American
         Association for Testing Materials, the American Association
         for the Advancement of Science and the American Association
         of University Women. In 1986, she received the first
         Governor's Award for Outstanding New Mexico Women. She again
         garnered the award in 1993.</P>
         
         <P>Fritz is survived by her husband, Joe; sons, Peter and
         David; daughter, Diane; parents, Pierre and Bertha Thomas;
         sister, Elizabeth; and brother, Peter.</P>

         at the last Board Meeting. It had been a while since I had
         seen her and as always she was eager to volunteer for tasks
         with which the board needed help. She also told us about the
         presentation she was preparing for a meeting of the Northern
         Chapter and for the Annual Meeting on women involved in the
         Los Alamos Project. I was really looking forward to hearing
         it. Georgia will indeed be missed.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Speaking of the Annual Meeting -- it's
         just around the corner! Northern Chapter has been busy for
         months planning all the details and making arrangements. It
         sounds like it will be another great time for all. Don't
         forget to fill out your registration form and mail it in

         women to pursue careers in math and science is very
         satisfying. </FONT></P>

<CENTER><B>ADVANCES TO CELEBRATE, MILES TO GO</B></CENTER>

<P>

<HR>

</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The National Science Foundation drew hundreds of
women and men-representing academia, research institutions,
government, museums, and professional societies-to the nation's
capital last December to examine the status of women in the
professions of science and engineering. The conference-Women and
Science, Celebrating Achievements, Charting Challenges-asked
participants to take stock of recent advances by women in the
scientific workplace and to identify current obstacles and future
challenges.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Before the conference began, participants had been
asked to identify overall trends and challenges within their own
disciplines. Their responses were wide-ranging. "The trend that
threatens opportunities for women in my field (physical
sciences/engineering) is the continued downsizing of
R&amp;D-particularly research-in corporations and national
laboratories," wrote one participant. A materials engineer stated
that many companies have strong recruiting programs for women (and
ethnic minorities) but no internal support system for these groups
once they're hired, perhaps a reflection of c corporate response to
government-mandated quotas.</FONT></P>

<P><B>Starting young</B></P>

<P>These and other observations seem to reflect an American cultural
climate that is changing, but still poses barriers to women in these
professions. Most participants agreed that more directed efforts are
needed to attract girls to the sciences, and that those efforts
should target girls at a younger age.</P>

<P>"The perception that physical sciences are 'too hard for a girl'
can only be overcome when girls truly believe they can do the work.
The fields are academically demanding, but not in any way beyond the
reach of individuals who are willing to do the work to develop the
background and understand the concepts, and who believe in their
abilities," wrote Meera Chandrasekhar, physics professor at the
University of Missouri-Columbia, and Rebecca Litherland, science
department, Columbia (Mo.) Public Schools.</P>

<P>"Although female participation in undergraduate geoscience
programs has increased significantly over the last decade-from 26.5
percent in 1985 to 35.9 percent in 1995-the environment in precollege
classrooms can still be 'chilly' for girls who are considering
careers in science," says Marilyn Suiter, AGI's director of Education
and Human Resources. "Teachers must learn to identify and diminish
negative cultural factors in the learning environment at all K-16
grade levels."</P>

<P>Participants at the breakout session, "Changing Curriculum and
Instruction," which Suiter chaired, recommended: 1) gender/equity
training, 2) documenting problematic behaviors of bias, and 3)
developing policies to deter harassment and other behaviors of
bias.</P>

<P>"The climate for girls at some schools can be very discouraging,"
agrees geoscientist Priscilla Grew, vice-chancellor for research at
the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Often it's a peer problem, rather
than a teacher problem, she added. Still, teachers should always be
careful about gender gaps within their classrooms: Are boys selected
more often than girls to lead activities or answer questions?</P>

<P><B>Career vs. family conflicts</B></P>

<P>While perceptions change over time, one problem will never go
away: the conflict between career-building and the biological clock.
Many conferees believed the career vs. family issue was the major
obstacle facing women scientists today.</P>

<P>"Many academic institutions do not have adequate maternity and
family-leave policies, so it is still difficult for women to cope
with the demands of having a family and a career," observed Carol B.
Lynch, dean of the graduate school and associate vice-chancellor for
research at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Often women
scientists elect not to have children, she added, or encounter
fertility problems if they delay their decision too long.</P>

<P>"Although institutions like the National Science Foundation have
good programs to help women scientists, it is the pervasive attitude
of science as "all consuming," perpetuated through home institutions
and by some colleagues, that serves as the main stumbling block to
the retention and advancement of women in our fields," states Carol
de Wet, geoscience professor (sedimentology) at Franklin &amp;
Marshall College, Lancaster, Pa. (Geotimes April 1995).</P>

<P>De Wet adds that women are still up against a science system that
was designed in the 1940s and '50s by men and reflects their
expectations and practices. But as Linda Wilson, president of
Radcliffe College, pointed out, it is that system that is now
obsolete, and or dysfunctional for the 1990s.</P>

<P><B>Science service?</B></P>

<P>The meeting highlighted one example of where the national agenda
and scientific community are out of step, says de Wet. There is an
emphasis on community involvement, and participation of scientists in
local schools, especially geared toward girls and their developing
attitudes toward science, is encouraged. "Women scientists have
typically participated in greater numbers at this level than have
their male counterparts, but it is unrecognized and unvalued-not
undervalued-by the professional scientific community," she states.
One part of the "sea change" would be to recognize the importance of
such work and give it value in tenure, promotion, and national
standing.</P>

<P><B>Struggles for acceptance</B></P>

<P>One of the purposes of the conference was to acknowledge the gains
that women scientists have already made and the changes they have
helped bring about. "In preparing for this conference," said
Priscilla Grew, "I stumbled across the fact (news to me) that I had
been only one of four women in the United States to earn a Ph.D. in
earth science in 1967. The cohort changes in the last three decades
in terms of women earning earth-science degrees at all levels have
been indeed remarkable."</P>

<P>Yet Grew's discussion group also noted that there still appears to
be a "glass ceiling"- women have not attained substantial cohort
strength in senior tenured positions at leading universities.</P>

<P>Marine scientist Vera Alexander observed that there has been "a
clear and quite dramatic increase" in the number of professional
women in her field over the past decade which reflects, she believes,
an increasingly supportive atmosphere in most oceanography graduate
programs.</P>

<P>But acceptance of women as equal professional partners varies from
one discipline to the next. Alexander also noted that the acceptance
and availability of women in the field of fisheries is far lower than
in marine science. "There is a great deal of tradition in
&#91;that&#93; field," she says, "and I suspect that this, too, is
changing slowly."</P>

<P>Daryl Chubin, director of NSF's Division of Research, Evaluation,
and Communication (Education and Human Resources Directorate) and one
of the conference planners, agrees. "There are many differences
between scientific fields; we gained a clearer understanding of how
discouraging it is for women to work and gain advancement within
certain disciplines."</P>

<P><B>Future conferences</B></P>

<P>Most attendees found that the opportunities to interact with women
in their own fields as well as other disciplines were particularly
valuable. "I hope the NSF will organize a follow-up conference," says
Grew. "Next time, I think women in private-sector R&amp;D should be
invited. Universities are increasing their interaction with industry
and we need to develop linkages among women geoscientists in both the
academic and private-sector communities."</P>

<P>And, she added with a laugh, next time the conference should NOT
take place concurrently with the annual meeting of the American
Geophysical Union, an event which forced many women geoscientists to
choose between events in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.</P>

<P>The conference last December-the first on this subject sponsored
by NSF as a cross-agency event-was planned and administered by the
Education and Human Resources Directorate. But other directorates
within NSF may manage the next conference, says Chubin. A conference
report is expected to be available by the end of the current academic
year, he adds. For additional information, contact the Web site of
NSF's Education and Human Resources Directorate:

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The meeting was called to order at 10:10 a.m. at
the home of Karen Schultz Paige by President Libby Haas with the
following Board Members present: Kelli Bitner, Mary Bochmann,
Adrienne Dare, Libby Haas, Yolanda Jones King, Deborah Kubicek, Karen
Schultz Paige and Wyona Turner. Proxies were held for Mercedes
Agogino and dede Collins. Past Board Member Georgia Fritz was a guest
at the meeting and volunteered to serve as Secretary for the next two
meetings. The minutes from the April meeting were reviewed and
approved. The Treasurer's report was not available. Reports were
heard from Standing Committees and chapters. New business included a
discussion of ordering lapel pins to be made available at the Annual
Meeting in October. The proposal was approved and lapel pins will be
ordered. The meeting adjourned at 12:05 p.m.</FONT>

<P><B>Central Chapter (Kelly Bitner)</B></P>

<P>The Central Chapter met on June 19 at the home of Ellen Evans. Our
guest speaker, Dr. Ellen Louderbough, explained the legal basis for
City of Albuquerque v Environmental Protection Agency. Dr.
Louderbough was a clerk for Judge Mechem at the time of his ruling on
this case.</P>

<P>The business portion of the meeting included a summary of the last
State Board meeting minutes. Debby Potter indicated that she may be
interested in an At-Large Board position</P>

<P><B>Northern Chapter</B></P>

<P>Summer is a slower time for the Northern Chapter and we have fewer
meetings and activities than usual. We started the spring with an
interesting talk on fissils by Maureen Hudson. Unfortunately, the
talk was not as well attended as we had hoped. However, those that
did attend enjoyed learning about fossils and trying out their new
knowledge on the fossil hunting expedition she lead us on the next
day.</P>

<P>In mid-June we hosted our annual summer picnic. This is our big
membership drive for the year and over eighty tickets wre sold for
the event. We grilled hamburgers and hotdogs over gas grills in order
to comply with the current fire restrictions. The party-goers
included women from a wide range of technical fields, students,
families, children, and dogs. Many women picked up brochures and
application forms so we are hopeful about the outcome of this
membership drive.</P>

<P>Future activities for the northern chapter include plans for a
lunch-time talk from Georgia Fritz on the women involved in the
Manhattan Project. In addition, our chapter is planning our own
annual meeting, held every September, as well as the State NMNWSE
Annual Meeting.</P>

<P><B>1996 Annual Meeting (Deborah Kubicek)</B></P>

<P>It is time again for NMNWSE's Annual Meeting and Symposium. This
year's conference will be held October 18-20th at the Fort Marcy
Compound in Santa Fe. I have stopped by to take a peek and it is a
very lovely, serene, condo-like community. It is located a few blocks
from the infamous downtown Santa Fe plaza. We will schedule the
meetings to allow for some free time to explore/shop around.</P>

<P>We were lucky to get a New Mexico State Representative, Liz
Stefanics, as our keynote speaker for Saturday's lunch and a surprise
Entertainer for Saturday evening. The Registration form and Call for
Papers is enclosed in this Newsletter. The more people that attend,
the more fun we'll all have! Don't miss out on a chance to meet some
of the other women in the Network and to visit the capital of our
great state. For more information, don't hesitate to contact me by
phone: (505) 665-2150 or by email: kubicek@lanl.gov.</P>

<P><B>Elections (Kelli Livermore)</B></P>

<P>Rachael Pitts has said she is not willing to run for Treasurer
again. Therefore, we need an individual who is. I recommend the
President appoint a Secretary for one year, and next year we nominate
and elect a Secretary.</P>

<P>We need a candidate (or more!) for Vice President/President-Elect.
Additionally, we need a candidate to fill the position of
member-at-large for two different positions. One is the one I will be
vacating, the other is the position which was established in the 1995
election.</P>

<P>Adrienne Dare and Wyona Turner have both agreed to run for their
positions again. Thanks to both of them for carrying on.</P>

<P>I have asked each of (the Board members) to bring names of
interested individuals. Because I am unable to attend the June
meeting, I ask you to please mail them to me.</P>

<P>Ballots will be mailed the week after the next Board of Director's
meeting. The return date will be on or before September 15.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">(The following article was apparently intended for
the April Newsletter but was not received in time. I am printing it
here because, even though late, the message is important for all
members to hear.)</FONT></P>

<P>Job Description:</P>

<P>Elections Chair</P>

<P>The operating by-laws and policies and procedures for this
position are these:</P>

<P><B>Article IV Board of Directors</B></P>

<P>Section 4.2 The Board of Directors of the NETWORK shall consist of
no fewer than six (6) and no more than fifteen (15) members. A
minimum of three (3) Directors shall be elected at large by the
membership of the NETWORK. One (1) Director shall be elected by the
membership of each of the chapters. Officers of the NETWORK shall
also be members of the Board. The Directors elected by the membership
at large of the NETWORK shall serve for two (2) year terms. The terms
of the Directors elected by the membership of each chapter shall be
for a period of (1) year or until their successors have been
chosen.</P>

<P>Section 4.3 Election of officers and members of the Board of
Directors shall be by written ballot. Installation shall be at the
annual meeting.</P>

<P><B>Article V Officers</B></P>

<P>Section 5.2 The term of office for the President and
President-elect shall be one (1) year with the President-Elect
automatically succeeding to the office of President. The terms for
office for the Secretary and Treasurer shall be two (2) years.</P>

<P>STANDING COMMITTEES<BR>
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</P>

<P>Election Committee Chair</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Is a member of the Board of Directors and attends Board of
   Directors Meetings.</LI>
   
   <LI>Chairs a committee to establish a slate for election of
   NETWORK officers and members of the Board of Directors according
   to the standard procedure on Elections (Procedure 89-PR02).</LI>
   
   <LI>Contributes to furthering the work of the Board of Directors
   and the NETWORK.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Standard Procedures</P>

<P>89-PR02</P>

<P>The Chair of the Election Committee supervises the establishment
of a slate of candidates. In accomplishing this, she must become
familiar with Article IV, Sections 4.1 through 4.3 and Article V of
the NETWORK Bylaws and have available a list of the terms of the
current officers and the directors.</P>

<P>The nominating process begins in the spring. The slate of
candidates is to be completed and the mailing labels provided to the
Election Committee by the August Board meeting.</P>

<P>Recommended process: At the April meeting, request one person from
each Chapter poll that Chapter's members to determine who might be
interested in and competent to hold the position(s) coming up in the
next election. At-large members rotate every other year. As it now
stand, the Secretary and the Treasurer were both elected in the 1994
election. The Secretary should not be elected again until 1997 to
restore the proper cycle.</P>

<P>An attempt should be made to keep the Board as balanced as
possible regarding representation of the Chapters. Thus, the Network
tries to elect a President/Elect from Central, then from Northern,
then from Southern. In 1996, the President/Elect should come from the
Southern Chapter if at all possible. In addition, the
members-at-large should also represent the various Chapters/regions
as much as possible. Thus, in 1996, one candidate from Northern
Chapter, one candidate from Southern Chapter, and one candidate from
Central Chapter should be on the ballot. In addition, a new Committee
Chair has been created, Publicity, and that position needs to be
filled. Lastly, Wyona Turner was appointed by the President to fill
the position Lynda Towers vacated so when the appointments take place
at the annual meeting, that issue will need to be addressed.</P>

<P>The election results are announced at the annual meeting and
publicized in the newsletter following the annual meeting. The
membership elects the members at large, but the President appoints
each member-at-large to Chair a Standing Committee. That is usually
negotiated at the Board meeting which takes place during the Annual
Meeting.</P>

<P>Thus, I would like each Board member to leave this meeting with
the intent to recruit future Board members. Those same individuals
can "recruit" themselves if they're interested in staying on the
Board, but I would like to have a list of individuals from each
Chapter/region presented to me at the June meeting. Of course, the
information presented in the "recommended process" of this report
should be used to establish criteria for recruitment.</P>

<P>The individuals whos positions are up for election in the 1996
election are: Vice President/President Elect Lynda Towers; either
Secretary (vacant now) or Treasurer (Rachael Pitts) should be elected
this year, <B>but not both</B>. We need to get out of the routine in
which they are both elected in the same year. I have no idea how that
happened. Members-at-large up for re-election: Kelli Livermore,
Adrienne Dare, Wyona Turner and the new member-at-large position. I
do not wish to run again. Although Wyona has only occupied the
position of Membership Committee Chairman since she was appointed in
October 1995, because Lynda Towers occupied it for a year prior to
that, the position is up for this election.</P>

<P><B>Science Fair</B></P>

<P>NMNWSE Awards for Young Women's Projects at the April 13, 1996
Science Fair in Socorro, New Mexico</P>

<P>Senior Engineering: Kanika Chawla, Socorro HS, Socorro, NM,
"Biomimetics: Materials Engineering in Nature Phase III, Finite
Element Method."<BR>
This is the third year of Kanika's project in which she first studied
the structure of shells with their alternating hard and soft layers.
The next year she constructed an artificial composite with similar
alternating layers and studied its properties. This year she used
finite elements to model the composite and found that it accurately
simulated fracture behavior.</P>

<P>Senior Environmental Science: Jennifer A Thompson, Farmington HS,
Farmington, NM, "Refuse Reclamation of Saccharomyces cerevisias in
Creating Flocculant Aid for Wastewater Treatment."<BR>
Jennifer investigated the possibility of improving the removal of
lead from contaminated wastewater. She compared removal by lysed S.
cerevisias alone, polyelectrolite filtration alone, and in
combination. The combination was most efficient, increasing removal
from 77% to 92%.</P>

<P>Junior Earth and Space Science, Tamara M. Holcomb, Madison MS,
Albuquerque, NM, "What Are the Load Bearing Capacities of Different
Soils?"<BR>
Concerned with reports of houses slowly sinking, Tamara tested three
types of material: east mesa soil, sand, and arroyo gravel, to
determine their load bearing characteristics. Her test consisted of
measuring the depth a dowel would sink into each material with
different loadings; east mesa soil was best, the sand was next, and
the gravel was very poor.</P>

<P>Junior Engineering, Lindsey M. Gardner, Van Buren HS, Albuquerque,
NM, "Lindsey's Automatic Double-Dutch Jump Rope Machine."<BR>
Because "Jumping Rope is a sport I really enjoy," Lindsey decided to
build a machine that would turn the rope, so that she could jump
double-dutch any time she wanted. Her first effort using a ceiling
fan and tetherball pole failed. Her next machine, using bicycle
wheels and an old air conditioner motor worked. It can safely turn
one or two ropes at two different speeds.</P>
