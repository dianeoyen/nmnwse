         <P>By now all of our Expanding Your Horizons Conferences are
         over. I was able to visit with Adrienne at her Conference in
         Silver City and I did go to Wyona's in El Paso. I also
         survived the Conference at White Sands on the
         18<SUP>th</SUP> of March. All were great, positive, learning
         experiences for the students that attended. I am still
         receiving positive feedback through the grapevine and am
         pleased that the Conferences went well, but especially that
         they are over for this year. I haven't heard about the
         Albuquerque EYH nor Los Alamos EYH, but assume all went
         well.</P>
         
         <P>I have been spreading the word, at least in the Southern
         part of the state, about the Network. I hope to have
         contacts (and members) from the schools, New Mexico State,
         and the local businesses. I had lunch with Dr. Linda Riley,
         NMSU, who has a grant to develop workshops designed to help
         steer girls to engineering. We discussed combining resources
         and helping each other reach our very similar goals. I also
         had several teachers and sponsors at our EYH ask for
         membership forms and about our meetings. Silver City and
         WSMR newspapers carried articles about our EYH (did
         Albuquerque or Los Alamos?) Spreading the word about us is
         the Network part. As members, we can talk the Network to
         every source we meet -- you never know where the next member
         will come from.</P>
         
         <P>Next up is the Science Fair in Socorro, New Mexico. We
         again will be awarding 5 senior prizes of $50.00 and 5
         junior prizes of $30.00 to young women who have excelled in
         their category.</P>
         
         <P>Plans are in the works to have a 20<SUP>th</SUP> Year
         Anniversary. Flyers should be in the mail soon announcing
         the event. Please come and bring friends. Also, attached to
         that flyer is a Bylaw change. We will vote on this change at
         the Annual Meeting in October.</P>
         
         <P>At the April Board meeting, immediately after the
         judging, in Socorro, we will be discussing another Procedure
         change. The issue of the liability insurance that is
         required (and recommended by the Math/Science Network) needs
         to be added to Duties and Responsibilities of a Committee
         Chair. This year, the liability insurance was purchased from
         an independent insurance agent in Alamogordo and they are
         more than willing to provide this insurance again next year.
         Also, the amount on the line item for the State EYH should
         be increased. If any member has an opinion of how this
         should be handled, please contact me before the April
         meeting. Or better yet, bring your opinion to the Board
         meeting -- all are welcome.</P>
         
         <P>Reminders: 1. If anyone wants information placed on the
         web site, please send it to Carol La Delfe. 2. The amendment
         to the Bylaws will be voted on by the membership at the
         Annual Meeting, 16 October, 1999, and not at the June
         6<SUP>th</SUP> Board Meeting. If you have sent a vote to
         Nancy, (Elections Chair), your vote will be kept until
         October.</P>
         
         <P>See many of you in April.</P>

         <H3>TREASURER</H3>
         
         <P>Welcome Claudia: She presented the budget for '97 and
         '98. There are few cost overruns. The '97 actual overrun is
         ~3k in EHY printing but over the course of 2 years it will
         balance out.</P>

         <H4>Annual Meeting</H4>
         
         <P>No report. Dede sent the proxy to Kelly. Linda called to
         say that they are "looking at a number of sites". Nine sites
         are possible for the Annual meeting.</P>

         <H4>Fundraising</H4>
         
         <P>Yolanda King is moving to Washington for 2 years. Though
         we are losing a great fundraiser, we wish her great new
         horizons! The official fundraising report for FY98 is
         $4,100. Yolanda reported great news from the New Mexico
         Children's Foundation. We finally received $2,500 from the
         Foundation for educational purposes. The Foundation has
         requested a monthly/quarterly report of expenditure. Intel
         is interested in funding us and asked NMNWSE to "please
         submit a proposal for $5,000. This is a great opportunity
         and we should get going on this! Yolanda suggested that we
         include the names of our sponsors in our booklets, to
         acknowledge their contributions.</P>
         
         <P>Karen Saenz asked for suggestions from members at large
         to fill Yolanda's position. There is a disk with the entire
         database and all fundraising letters that will help the new
         fundraiser.</P>
         
         <H4>Membership</H4>
         
         <P>Current status: 43 total: 30 Professional, 8 Retired, 5
         Students (or unemployed). We sent a package of brochures to
         Mercedes. We welcome new members Nachelle (Shelly) Pell,
         Barbara Wahsburn, Karen Browne and Cameron Langner whom all
         came from the Annual Meeting! There was a discussion whether
         changes to the applications should go out through snail mail
         or ASCII/pdf. This is discussed at length in newsletter
         report.</P>
         
         <H4>Newsletter</H4>
         
         <P>Welcome Angelique! There was a long discussion as to
         whether we should send the newsletters hard copy or
         electronically. It was noted that Carol La Delfe already
         includes the newsletter on the web site. In the next
         newsletter (last one) we shall ask member preferences.
         "Please let us know if you would prefer a hard copy". There
         are 6-7 members that do not have e-mail addresses. One idea
         was to send out an e-mail announcing that the arriving
         newsletter was on the web using an embedded URL to the site.
         We are required to have a newsletter 4 times a year by law.
         Further discussion is necessary. Action item: Carol will
         prepare a NMNWSE notebook to send to Angelique.</P>

         <P>Report provided by Adrienne Dare. Adrienne has registered
         the sites with the Math/Science Network. As soon as the
         student and adult packages arrive Adrienne will send these
         on to each site coordinator.</P>
         
         <H4>Albuquerque EYH</H4>
         
         <P>Yolanda King reported. The EYH is going very well. Anita
         Reiser has been transferring her knowledge of the Pittsburgh
         EYH (800 students) to our operation-especially her
         relational database. Beth Dillingham, head of the
         educational department will also do a hands-on workshop at
         EYH. Nan made contact with the AAUW and they appear to be
         willing to help. The Girl Scouts Council will distribute
         information through their network. Kim Lindner has been
         contacting minority groups and companies to help get
         additional speakers and attendees. The next meeting is at
         lunchtime, Coronado club, Dec. 8, 1998. No budget to
         present.</P>
         
         <H4>Los Alamos EYH</H4>
         
         <P>Margo Clark reported. There was one EYH meeting. This
         year's EYH committee is being formed. It will be held on
         March 29, 1999. Some of the committee chairs are selected.
         No budget presented. Sciece education has some discretionary
         funds that may be useful.</P>
         
         <H4>Las Cruces EYH</H4>
         
         <P>Karen Saenz reported. The chapter EYH will be held March
         18, 1999 at White Sands Missile Range. We will keep the same
         format as last year. To date four presenters have agreed to
         lead a workshop again. We are having the EYH in conjunction
         with the Women's History Month here at WSMR. The approval
         letter has been submitted to the General for approval and
         the rooms have been reserved. Also submitted is the proposed
         budget to next years conference. EYH budget includes income
         of $1565 (seed money $300, Registrations $1200, and adult
         lunches $65). Expenses totaled $1515 (letters/postage $100,
         Supplies $315, Food $1100).</P>
         
         <H4>Silver City</H4>
         
         <P>Adrienne Dare reported. The EYH conference at Western New
         Mexico University, Silver City will be held February 27,
         1999. They are expecting 150 girls and 50 adults. There will
         be two separate conferences. Planning is going well.
         Adrienne is thinking of reusing left over T-shirts from
         previous years and putting something new on the backs.</P>
         
         <P>Adrienne submitted the proposed budget for this year's
         conference. The total income for the conference is $2300
         that consists of: (1) Seed money from NMNWSE = $300, (2)
         Registration for girls (150x$5)=$750, (3) Registration for
         adults (50x$5)=$250, (4) Donation from local businesses =
         $1000. The total expenses are $2300 that consists of: (1)
         Lunch (200x$7)=$1400, (2) T-shirts and supplies (paper
         postage badges, etc.) (150x$3 + $25 + $200)=$675, (3) prizes
         $75, (4) Potluck (30x$5)=$150.</P>
         
         <H3>CHAPTER REPORTS</H3>
         
         <H4>Central</H4>
         
         <P>Yolanda King reported. Central Chapter met at Yanni's for
         a social/networking dinner on 12 November '98. We had about
         ten members show up. Nan Founds gave a brief update of the
         EYH plans. Otherwise we got to know each other a little
         better. The next meetings are January 20, 1999 at Nan
         Founds' home to work on EYH maillings/stuffings or whatever
         the committee needs and April 21, 1999 at Debbie
         Brinkerhoff's house for a regular meeting, speaker TBD. We
         have also been brainstorming about how to increase
         participation and membership. Nan took applications to the
         EYH speaker's training and distributed them.</P>
         
         <H4>Eastern</H4>
         
         <P>No report.</P>
         
         <H4>Northern</H4>
         
         <P>Margo Clark reported. The LAWIS steering committee
         appointed Wendee Brunish to chair the Nomination Committee
         for new members for our steering committee. Wendee appointed
         Amy Anderson to be on the Committee. The nominating
         committee sent out ballots on November 30, 1998 and they
         must be returned by December 14, which is two days prior to
         our annual meeting on December 16, 1998.</P>
         
         <P>The LAWIS steering committee also appointed Dede Collins
         to char the Bylaws Committee for purposes of creating
         revisions to our policies and/or bylaws. She has appointed
         Nancy Scheer to serve on that Committee.</P>
         
         <P>The LAWIS Christmas party is December 16, at6 PM at Carol
         La Delfe's home: 600 Los Pueblos, Los Alamos. Meeting begins
         at 6:30 the new steering committee will be announced. Bylaws
         revisions if any will be voted on and a potluck dinner will
         follow. There will be no speaker but lots of fun and
         fellowship!</P>

         <P>Karen Saenz reported. We still have no officers and have
         not had a meeting. I polled the members to see if they would
         agree to sponsor the Mentoring Pilot Program Kick Off on
         December 17, 1998. Response so far has been favorable. The
         chapter will provide funds along with other organizations,
         for refreshments for the Kick Off. One requirement of the
         mentoring program is for each prot&eacute;g&eacute; to join
         a WSMR sponsored organization and participates in their
         activities. We hope to gain members from the program. We are
         attempting to have the books audited this month, depending
         on work schedules. Southern needs more brochures.</P>

            <LI>There was a long discussion of Linda Towers' letter
            to the US Department of Education. The USDE says that we
            owe them money for some grant that we are not familiar
            with. The USDE must have the wrong group. Linda wrote the
            letter. Gary (State Representative, attorney) will
            rewrite it and send it out.</LI>
            
            <LI>There was another long discussion about where we want
            to keep our banking account. Claudia wants to decide this
            soon. No one likes Nations Bank. We are looking into
            First State Bank.</LI>

         <H4>Membership</H4>
         
         <P>There are currently 91 members. Mailing labels for
         members who did not renew this year were prepared and given
         to representatives of those chapters. Chapters may choose to
         do some follow up on these members. An amendment was
         proposed by Wyona to extend membership of new members who
         join in the last quarter. Notice of the proposed amendment
         will be sent with a special mailing (early April) announcing
         the anniversary celebration to be held June 5<SUP>th</SUP>.
         A vote on the proposed Bylaws Amendment will be taken at
         that meeting of the membership.</P>
         
         <H4>Newsletter</H4>

         <P>Science Fair date is April 17<SUP>th</SUP>. Mercedes
         Agogino needs judges. She currently has three including
         herself. Wendy Brunish is helping. This year we can start
         special judging at 8 AM. In last year's minutes, Mercedes
         reminded everyone that they may be sent judges forms this
         year, but return them ONLY if you are willing to judge all
         the projects. Volunteers are requested only for the special
         judging of the Network. It was agreed that the Network would
         again give 10 awards: 5 Senior Division at $50 each and 5
         Junior Division at $35 each. The following categories were
         recommended: Earth and Space Science, Physics and
         Engineering, Math and Computer Science, Environmental
         Science, and Life Science (Medicine and Health Sciences,
         Zoology, and Botony). These categories may be adjusted.
         Wyona and Karen will set up a table in the judges' room
         again.</P>

         <P>Adrienne sent out both the adult and the student packet
         information. 200 career booklets were delivered to Southern
         and Karen will send 50 booklets to Central Chapter. Adrienne
         had about 100 folders and did not know where the others were
         (Southern needs more for their conference). She reminded
         chapters to return the Math/Science Network evaluation of
         the conference and 10 of their brochures to her as soon as
         possible after their conference.</P>
