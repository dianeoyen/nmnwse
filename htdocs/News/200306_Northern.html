	<b>Northern Chapter Report: June</b> 
</p>
<p>
	<br>
	At the brief &quot;board meeting&quot; before the LAWIS LunchTalk on May 20, 
	<br>
	following a brief discussion of the status of the board a vote was taken 
	<br>
	of those present which expressed a preference to 
	<br>
	<br>
	(1) have those &quot;current&quot; LAWIS board members as are able continue on the 
	<br>
	board until a new board can be elected 
	<br>
	<br>
	(2) allow those &quot;current&quot; board members whose time commitments do not 
	<br>
	allow them to continue to gracefully leave the board, with our thanks 
	<br>
	for staying on as long as they have 
	<br>
	<br>
	(3) request the NMNWSE board, especially those members based in Los 
	<br>
	Alamos, help with re-organizing the LAWIS board and electing a new local 
	<br>
	board - possibly smaller and with a refocused scope (focus only on EYH 
	<br>
	with the rest of the LAWIS duties relegated to the state board?). 
	<br>
	<br>
	Thus: 
	<br>
	<br>
	(A) All those listed on the &quot;To&quot; line please let me know if you are or 
	<br>
	are not willing to continue to be listed on the website 
	<br>
	<a href="http://lawis.lanl.gov/NMNWSE_Northern.html">http://lawis.lanl.gov/NMNWSE_Northern.html</a> as filling the LAWIS board 
	<br>
	position listed for you there. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Note I have already heard back from Lisa Colletti that she is willing to 
	<br>
	handle the treasurer duties as long as needed (within reason, of 
	<br>
	course). Is anyone checking the LAWIS PO Box?? These are probably the 
	<br>
	two most critical until EYH gears up again. 
	<br>
	<br>
	(B) I propose we add discussion of LAWIS status to the next NMNWSE board 
	<br>
	meeting (June 7 in Santa Fe), and invite the &quot;current&quot; LAWIS board (or 
	<br>
	at least those willing/able to stay on). 
	<br>
	<br>
	I presume no vote is needed, and so I can consider this item &quot;added to 
	<br>
	the June 7 agenda&quot;? And LAWIS people &quot;hereby invited&quot;? (with details of 
	<br>
	location etc to be emailed soon) 
	<br>
	<br>
	(C) I'll be happy to be the person to collect email suggestions as to 
	<br>
	how to proceed re getting LAWIS back on it's feet with a proper board 
	<br>
	and etc, so if June 7 doesn't work for you please email me your 
	<br>
	suggestions and/or concerns. (and of course, if someone else wants to 
	<br>
	take this off my hands - please do!) 
	<br>
	<br>
	(D) If we want to continue the local discussion, I suggest as a time at 
	<br>
	11:30 on June 11 (so just before the June 11 LunchTalk at 12:00).
