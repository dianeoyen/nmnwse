<H2><A NAME=RTFToC1></A>PRESIDENTS MESSAGE</H2>

<P>by Libby Haas</P>

<P>SPRING! Another truly magnificent time of the year. I wander
through my yard almost every day just to see what new plants are
poking their tiny green leaves up through the dirt and mulch, and
which spring flowering trees and shrubs are bursting forth in their
glorious displays. The bulbs started early and are going strong -- as
one fades, another takes its place. And I've seen lots of robins, so
I know that spring is truly here. Now, if only the weather will
cooperate so we don't lose fruit again like we did last year.</P>

<P>The seasons come and go, each with exciting things to see and do,
and likewise in the Network, as one activity time passes by, another
comes along to take its place. The Expanding Your Horizons throughout
the state were wonderful! Congratulations to each chapter for another
successful year and thanks to each and every one of you who
contributed your talents to these efforts. It is heartwarming to talk
to those involved and hear stories of how much the conferences mean
to students. At the Silver City conference, one of the presenters had
attended an EYH conference in Las Cruces when she was a student!</P>

<P>And now it is time to move on to planning the Annual Meeting --
can it possibly be that time again? A lot of work goes into an annual
meeting and Northern Chapter is busy with their planning. I can't
wait to see what exciting things are in store for us in the Santa Fe
Old Town area!</P>

<P>It is also time to begin planning for the next elections. If you
would be willing to serve on the State Board of Directors, please let
Kelli Livermore know so that she can include you I her planning. It
is great to have a mix of long time members and new members on the
Board so that we can share both in continuity and in new ideas.
Please give it some serious thought, and I'll look forward to working
with you on next year's board.</P>

<P>Libby</P>

<H2><A NAME=RTFToC2></A>BOARD MEETING</H2>

<P>February 10, 1996.</P>

<P>The meeting was called to order at 10:10 a.m. at the home of
Adrienne Dare in Silver City by President Libby Haas with the
following Board Members present: Kelli Bitner, Mary Bochmann,
Adrienne Dare, Libby Haas, Carol LaDelfe, Karen Schultz Paige and
Wyona Turner. Proxies were held for Mercedes Agogino, dede Collins,
and Yolanda Jones King. The minutes from the December meeting were
reviewed and approved as was the Treasurer's report. Reports were
heard from Standing Committees and chapters. The meeting adjourned at
12:05 p.m.

<HR>

</P>

<H2><A NAME=RTFToC3></A>CHAPTER REPORTS</H2>

<H3><A NAME=RTFToC4></A>Central Chapter</H3>

<P>The Chapter met at the home of Rosalie Graves on January 17.
Information packets for the Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) conference
were prepared for mailing to all Albuquerque Public Schools, private
schools in Albuquerque, and public schools in surrounding areas such
as Grants, Los Lunas, Moriarty, and Bernalillo. The next meeting will
be held on April 17 at the home of Beulah Woodfin.</P>

<H3><A NAME=RTFToC5></A>Northern Chapter</H3>

<P>The Board for the Northern Chapter had one meeting in January and
then decided to postpone further Board meetings until April, after
the EYH conference. In April, Ginger Young will coordinate a speaker
on geology and fossils with a field trip for members.</P>

<P>At the January meeting, we found out that Board member Rosalie
Multari received a job offer from Intel in Albuquerque and will be
quitting the Board (and possibly transferring her membership to
Central). Board member Kay Strong also agreed to step down from the
Board. Rosalie's replacement for the 18 month term will be Diane
Albert, who is on the Women's Diversity Group at LANL. Rosalie's
position as Liaison to the State Board is being taken by Deborah
Kubicek, who is also the 1996 NMNWSE Annual Meeting chair. Kay's
replacement for the 6 month term will be Libby Jones. We look forward
to working with our new Board members.</P>

<P>Northern Chapter again participated in the Los Alamos Science
Fair, held Feb. 10. Three gift certificates from a local book store
were awarded as prizes to the best female entries. Judges were Wendee
Brunish, Ginger Young, and Deborah Kubicek.</P>

<H3><A NAME=RTFToC6></A>Southern Chapter</H3>

<P>Southern Chapter has been meeting every month and has had a number
of committee meetings (face-to-face, telephonically and email)
reference the 96 EYH.</P>

<H3><A NAME=RTFToC7></A>Eastern Chapter</H3>

<P>No report.

<H2><A NAME=RTFToC9></A>STANDING COMMITTEE REPORTS.</H2>

<H3><A NAME=RTFToC10></A>1996 Annual Meeting</H3>

<P>The Northern Chapter is organizing the 1996 NMNWSE Annual Meeting
and Symposium. We plan to make this the best conference ever. We have
already met twice and have accomplished a lot. Deborah Kubicek is the
Committee Chair and Ann Mauzy is head of accommodations and
facilities.</P>

<P>Other members on the committee include Wendee Brunish, dede
Collins, Alexine Salazar, Nancy Scheer, Nina Thayer, Lynda Towers,
and Ginger Young.</P>

<P>The 1996 NMNWSE Annual Meeting will be held Friday October 18th
through Sunday October 20th. It will be located at the Fort Marcy
Compound Hotel Suites in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The State
Representative Liz Stefanics has already agreed to be our keynote
speaker for Friday afternoon. This year's conference theme is "Women
as the Leaders--from Traditions to the Future".</P>

<P>I have received a membership list from Deborah Kubicek from the
Northern chapter. That list shows 46 members. I have only received
notification for five of those members. Thirty-one of the remaining
members are listed in the 1994-95 Membership Directory, but there is
no record for another five members listed. (An unknown code accounted
for the remaining five names.) I will send her the three names that
were not on her list (2 renewals and 1 new) and ask for information
about the others. Question: What is the status of those memberships
that I do not receive from Rachel?</P>

<P>FUTURE PLANS</P>

<P>The membership database is in the process of being transferred and
renewal letters will be sent next week.</P>

<H3><A NAME=RTFToC12></A>Newsletter (Carol LaDelfe)</H3>

<H3><A NAME=RTFToC15></A>Science Fair</H3>

<P>State Science Fair is on April 13 in Socorro. Judges are
needed.</P>

<H2><A NAME=RTFToC16></A>EYH</H2>

<P>The Student and Adult packets from the Math/Science Network have
been distributed to the EYH sites.</P>

<P>Yolanda King has had the folders printed. These should be
available to be distributed at the February board meeting, thanks to
Libby.</P>

<P>A lot of work has been put into revising the "Surveying Your
Future" booklet. Thanks to dede Collins and Kelli Livermore and
anyone else who worked so hard on this project. However, there still
seems to be a lot of outdated inforemation. Sometimes old references
were dropped but the text remained unchanged. The project was much
more complicated and involved than eany of us had anticipated.</P>

<P>I also had a conversation with the original editor of the
document, Mary Ann Sweeney. She wasn't comfortable with our changes.
She didn't think we should be changing text that someone else wrote.
Anyway, she is interested in being involved in a project to revise
the booklet if we wish to continue this effort. dede Collins has
suggested that if we do get the booklet revised we offer it to the
Math/Science Network. We should decide if we wish to continue the
effort to revise the booklet.</P>

<P>The Central chapter has indicated to me that they may wish to use
any left over booklets at their conference. I don't have any left but
some of the other sites may still have some.</P>

<P>I do have an alternative to offer. Betty Levitin from Math/Science
Network has sent me a copy of a 16 page Women in Science Newsletter
which she clams has been recently revised. If we decide we want to
order it at $0.75 each we can order them on 2/12/96 so that they will
arrive before the Las Cruces conference on Feb 24. Betty claims that
we should receive the newsletters in a week (7 days).</P>

<P><B>Central Chapter:</B> The Steering Committee for the EYH has
been very busy, under the direction of the co-chairs, Jerry Sue
Thompson and Rhonda Cole. Information packets for Central Chapter's
Albuquerque EYH have been prepared and mailed. As of February 7,
there were 17 volunteers for workshops and 17 volunteers for career
panels. Forty nine students and four adults have registered. It will
be held March 9 at University of New Mexico, with registration in the
Biology Building. The workshops and panels will be in different
buildings, depending on space and equipment needs.</P>

<P><B>Northern Chapter: </B> We held an EYH kickoff meeting on
December 5, at lunch. Five people attended the meeting. Since most of
them had worked on the EYH conference before, we set to work
assigning people to specific chair positions. Our EYH conference this
year will be on Wednesday, March 20. The EYH co-chairs are Shirley
Herrera (last year's EYH chair) and Joyce Guzik. The chair for EYH
treasurer will be Trish Wright. The chair for registration will be
Carol LaDelfe. The chair for workshop presenters will be Karen
Schultz Paige. The chair for contacting schools will be Ann Mauzy.
Nancy Scheer will be our liaison to AAUW who will be contacting the
Santa Fe schools for us. The most pressing issues to be dealt with
include contacting professional associations for career literature,
brainstorming team building activities for the girls, reserving rooms
and facilities needed, and recruiting presenters. We are working on
all of these issues. Our next EYH meeting will be in early
January.</P>

<P><B>Southern Chapter:</B></P>

<P>El Paso EYH Report submitted. EYH conference was held in
January.</P>

<P>Las Cruces. Southern chapter has targeted sixth graders in Las
Cruces and mid-school in the surrounding area. Schools in the area
have been contacted in person or though letters. About 110 students
have registered, with a maximum anticipated as 150. Keynote speaker
is Susanna Martinez, local attorney and candidate for District
Attorney in Las Cruces. Libby Haas, Mary Berry, Mary Bochmann, and
Carol Ann Council have been invited to welcome students. Publicity
has been provided on public TV. Some coordination problems have been
experienced between the network and the AAUW point of contact.
Pending items include food, T-shirts, and AV support.</P>

<P>Silver City: The conference will be held on the Western New Mexico
University Campus. The BPW (Business and Professional Women)
organization and PEO will be joining AAUW in helping sponsor the
event.</P>

<P>We hope to have 15 presenters. Next week we will finalize the
details about the presenters so that we can print up our brochures.
After registration from 9:00 - 9:30 there will be welcoming remarks.
If Libby will be attending our conference we would be delighted for
her to make a few comments in the morning. There will be two morning
workshops. Then lunch. Fortunately we do not have to use the food
service on campus. Western New Mexico has classes in Food Services -
for students preparing to be professional chefs. Joyce Solvesky, the
instructor, and her students do a fantastic job. And the price will
be better than food services. After lunch there will be a third
workshop. Then from 2:00 to 3:00 the entire group will meet in the
Gym for some group activities which encourage team work and
cooperation.</P>

<P>Organizing the conference is often frustrating but I do have a lot
of volunteers helping. For the most part everything seems to be going
along fine.</P>
