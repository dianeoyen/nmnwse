The recommendations below will start you on the road to "Being Financially Savvy."  These are made considering current tax law, which is always subject to change.
</P><P>
<B>1. <U>Dream!  Set goals and write them down</U></B>. Be specific.  People with written goals are far more likely to accomplish them than those without.
<P>
<table border=0 cellpadding=5>

What do you want to do and when?  
</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign="top">
How much will it cost?  
</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td valign="top"><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign="top">
Know why you are doing something!  
</td></tr></table>
Track your progress towards these goals and revise them as needed.
</P><P>
<B>2. <U>Know how you are spending your money</U></B>.  Your money can "trickle away" each month.  Carry a small notebook for a few weeks or a month and enter every expense.
Review your expenses and decide which could have been spent in a better way.   Every time you spend a dollar, you have chosen NOT to use it for something else.

</P><P>
<B>3. <U>When interviewing for a job, ask about the complete compensation package</U></B>, not just the salary or hourly wage.  Company provided benefits such as health insurance, 401k matches, and disability insurance are worth money.

</P><P>
<B>4. <U>Always save some portion of your paycheck</U></B>.  At a minimum, contribute enough to your company 401K to get the full company match,  This is FREE money.

</P><P>
<B>5. <U>Invest now for retirement</U></B>.  Even though your funds are limited, time is on your side.  At a 10% average rate of return, your money could double every 7.2 years.  $1,000 invested at Age 20 (with no additional contributions) could be $64,000 at Age 62.  This is the power of compounding. - a mathematical phenomenon Einstein called the Eighth Wonder of the World.

</P><P>
<B>6. <U>Open a Roth IRA</U></B>, if you're not itemizing deductions. Withdrawals will be tax-free in.

</P><P>
<B>7. <U>If offered a choice, pay disability insurance premiums with post-tax dollars.</U></B>  Then, should you need to collect benefits, they are tax-free.

</P><P>
<B>8. <U>Establish a good credit record</U></B> (but don't build up debt).

</P><P>
<B>9. <U>Do NOT build up excessive credit card debt</U></B>.
