<P> &nbsp;<br>
<B>NMNWSE is a registered 501(c)(3) public charity.</B>
Our public charity status is 170(b)(1)(A)(vi).
Donations are deductable to the extent provided by law.

<P>
Our legal name is <I><B>"New Mexico Network for Women in Science and Engineering, Inc"</b></I>. We are also known as "NMNWSE", and we were formerly known as the "Network for Women in Science and Engineering, Inc". If you need a copy of our most recent determination letter from the IRS, dated May 8, 2013, please <a href="mailto:NMNWSE_Board-L@list.unm.edu ?Subject=NMNWSE nonprofit status">contact the NMNWSE Board</a>. 

<!--
Our legal name as filed with the NM PRC is <I><B>"New Mexico Network for Women in Science and Engineering, Inc"</b></I>. We are also known as "NMNWSE", and we were formerly known as the "Network for Women in Science and Engineering, Inc". The change from our former to current legal name is reflected in our determination letter from the IRS dated Jan 6, 2010 which unfortunately reflected a typo and is missing the "in" (i.e., <I><B>"New Mexico Network for Women in Science and Engineering, Inc"</b></I>). We are in the process of filing the paperwork with the IRS to fix this.
-->

<P>
Our tax year is Oct 1 - Sep 30 (eg, FY 2010 was 10-1-2010 thru 9-30-2011).
Members needing nontaxable transaction certificates or other nontaxable ID numbers for allowable purchases should contact the NMNWSE treasurer.
