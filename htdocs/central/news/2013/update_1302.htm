<B>February 2013 Central Chapter Update</b>

<P>
Hi Central Chapter

<P>
The January Central Chapter was a very special evening as the 2013 IMPACT! Award was presented to Dr. Diane Albert. Plus Klaus Heinemann provided an update on the very successful Central EYH which had just taken place the Saturday before.

<P>
Our next meeting will be in mid-March, location undetermined at this time.  

<P>
I hope to see you at the March Central Chapter Meeting,

<P>
Jeanne  Banks, for the Central Chapter
