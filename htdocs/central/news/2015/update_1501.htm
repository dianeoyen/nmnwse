<P><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/button.gif" height=10>&nbsp;The February 18 meeting is cancelled - apologies for not getting out a notice sooner, especially as with the December and January weather cancellations it's been a while since we met.
<br><br>
<img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/button.gif" height=10>&nbsp;We hope to get back on track for the March 18 meeting - watch your email for details. And please get us your suggestions for future speakers/topics.

<!--

<img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/updated.gif">&nbsp;<b>JANUARY MEETING CANCELLED FUE TO WEATHER</b>
<P>
There will be no speaker at this month's Central Chapter meeting -- just networking, an update of activities for the spring and a chance to discuss future speakers and interests.

<P>
There will be six <a href="http://nmnwse.org/eyh">EYH conferences in NM</a> during the next year and we are asking you to consider bringing an item that can go in our "EYH goodies box" for raffling off to students or teachers who attend the Albuquerque EYH conference on February 7 or one of the other conferences around the state.
-->
 
<P>
Hope to see you at a Central Chapter meeting soon to meet and network with some wonderful women!  Mark Wednesday Mar 18, Apr 15 and May 20 on your calendars now!
