<P>
<img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/button.gif" height=10>&nbsp;We hope to get back on track for the May 20 meeting.
Phyllis Baca will be discussing the concept of Micromessaging in our STEM interactions and also the book, "Unleashing Diversity: Multicultural Competence for Business Results". 
<UL><LI> The <a href="http://www.napequity.org">National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity (NAPE)</a> Education Foundation has developed <a href="http://www.napequity.org/professional-development/teacher-training/">"Micromessaging to Reach and Teach Every Student"<sup>TM</sup></a> - a high-quality, research-based, educator professional development program to address gender- and culturally based implicit biases that occur in the classroom and that are manifested through "micromessages." This unique program provides participants with an awareness of the power of micromessages, which include looks, gestures, tone of voice, or the framing of feedback that subtly yet powerfully shape our culture, our classrooms, and the individuals within them.<br>&nbsp;
</LI><LI>In "Unleashing Diversity: Multicultural Competence for Business Results", the author Debjani Mukherjee-Biswas develops a groundbreaking new framework and practical guide to increase effectiveness through multi-cultural competence. In his endorsement, Marshall Goldsmith, Thinkers50 Award Winner for Most Influential Leader Thinker in the World says:
"Diversity - it's been a buzzword in corporate and political circles for about a decade. But most books on leadership and management simply don't address its importance to an organization's ability to survive and thrive. Enter Mukherjee-Biswas' Unleash the Power of Diversity. After reading her thought provoking book, few executives will be able to ignore the relevance of diversity to their company's growth and success."
