<P><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/button.gif" height=12>&nbsp;
The Sep 15 talk was presented by Lauren Starosta.  <! img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/updated.gif"><br>
<b>Lauren spoke on "Increasing Water Supply Resiliency under Climate Change"</b>, a project she did for the City and County of Santa Fe on the effects of climate change on their water supply.  I know the availability of water is a subject each of us in concerned about here in NM, and <! I believe you will find > I hopt you found Lauren's talk interesting and informative.

<b>Kelly Collins will speak on <I>"Putting out the Fire: Closing the Socorro Tire Fire Site"</I>:</b>
<br>
The Socorro Tire Fire site was formerly the location of a tire shredding and chipping operation.  In June 2000, a malfunctioning electrical transformer started 
a fire that burned a large portion of scrap tires on the 7- acre site. Burning tires were covered with soil to extinguish the fire. Scrap tires continued to smolder beneath this 
cover material in portions of the site, a condition which may have persisted until CDM Smith successfully and safely extinguished the tires during September 2011. Results of a 2005 site assessment indicated the presence of 35,867 cubic yards (cy) of waste material (tires and burned tire debris) and 37,600 cy of soil that covers the waste material. The presence of petroleum hydrocarbons (likely released through pyrolytic conversion of rubber compounds during the fire) was documented in soils beneath the burned tire debris. CDM Smith was contracted to "close" the site with a engineered cap. The closure was successful and the site is available for industrial use.

<P>
We hope you can join us for <! Kelly's > Lauren's talk!
Note there is no <! August > October Central Chapter meeting - we encourage you to attend the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2015">NMNWSE Annual meeting</a> in October.

This AAUW program is gaining momentum with 8th grade girls in NM, and Cheri's presentation showed it is a great opportunity for the girls, as well as a fun time for both the girls and the presenters.
They are looking for 2016 volunteers already, so if you'd like to be involved click on the 'volunteer' link on the Tech Trek webpage, <a href="http://techtrek-nm.aauw.net">http://techtrek-nm.aauw.net/</a>.

</P>

<P>
When we met on Jun 17, the group discussed making some changes to our Central Chapter meeting schedule and how to move forward with more meaningful meetings.  We want to improve communication, enhance networking opportunities, have diverse programs/speakers, and be more efficient with everyone's time. 
<P>
We are going to continue to meet in downtown Albuquerque at The Flying Star at 723 Silver Ave SW, but now slightly earlier, from 6:00p - 7:30p.  Each person simply goes through the line downstairs to order what they would like for dinner, then comes upstairs to the meeting room.  The wait staff deliver your meal to the meeting room.
