<P>Hi Everyone!  Fall is here--we are roasting green chile, aren't we!!? I warned you to mark the 12th on your calendars--hope you did!

<P>
Please join us upstairs in the fabulous Flying Star Cafe--Downtown, located near the corner of 8th and Central, easy parking on the east side.  Please order your dinner individually downstairs in typical Flying Star fashion, then come on upstairs for networking and fun. This should provide maximum flexibility for all. 

<P>
There is a slight charge ($4.00) in addition to your dinner--for use of the room and coffee, tea, water in the room.   Please respond by noon Monday, Sep 10, 2007.

<P>
A little business to take do--election of officers for the Central Chapter.

<P>
Hope to see you there--and forward to anyone you think would be interested!

<P>
If you can't make this meeting, mark November 7 on the calendar now!
