NMNWSE Members and Guests -- let's spend a glorious summer evening at the St Clair!  We will be dining al fresco on our own private patio.  Each person will order from the menu and pay individually for their meal...and, of course, any wonderful wine you may choose to sample!  The company will be stimulating as only the NM Network for Women in Science and Engineering can be.  Discussions will include local events of interest, available positions, and networking.  Hope to see you all there!  And, please bring a guest or two!

<P>
