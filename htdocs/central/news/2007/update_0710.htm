Hi Everyone--

<P>
Just as I had promised--our next meeting is on Wednesday, November 7!  Please come to BRAVO! in ABQ Uptown for an evening of networking and fine Italian food!  We will be having the BRAVO! chopped salad, with your choice of either Mama's Lasagna Bolognese, Wood-Fired Chicken Marsala, or Pasta BRAVO!  You can make your selection that evening.  The cost per person is $23.00. 

<P>
We will be filling you in on the happenings at our Annual meeting in Clayton last weekend.  It was a great conference!  For full details on the Network and the meeting, go to www.nmnwse.org
