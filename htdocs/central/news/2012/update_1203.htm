<P>
The Central Chapter of the New Mexico Network for Women in Science and Engineering met on February 15, 2012 at the St Clair Winery and Bistro near Old Town in Albuquerque.  There were 18 members and guests present for a very wonderful evening of networking, delicious dinner and the presentation of the 2011 <b>IMPACT! Award</b>.  The honored guests of the evening were Dr. Jane Selverstone, receiving the award, her husband, Dave Gutzler, and her nominator, Dr. Les McFadden.  After receiving the award from Jeanne Banks, Central Chapter President, Jane told us about her career path to UNM and shared many incidents of what is was like for a woman scientist in the 1960s.  We were all happy to say that great progress has been made-but agreed that there was more to be done to achieve equity for women in non-traditional fields.
<br> See the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/ImpactAward/winners/"><b>IMPACT! Award</b> winners</a> page for Jane's award citation. 

<P>Following the award ceremonies, CEYH co-chair Klaus Heinemann gave a brief report on the central chapter <a href="http://nmnwse.org/eyh/eyh_confs.php">Expanding Your Horizons</a> conference (CEYH).
Since moving the conference to January, attendance is increasing -- this year about 300 students attended.  Several emails were recieved thanking us for the "awesome experience". The students thought the hands on workshops were "great" and "really enjoyed the panel".  
All involved were congratulated on another successful conference.

<P>
