I hope everyone is having a marvelous holiday season--and is looking forward to a great 2009!  

<P>The first 2009 meeting of the Central Chapter of the New Mexico Network for Women in Science and Engineering will be a very special event!  We will present the IMPACT! Award to our own Betsy Frederick for her life-long contributions to education.  The NM Commission on the Status of Women will be there to help us celebrate Betsy's accomplishments.  We will begin the evening with a social hour.  Dinner will be served at 7:00pm.

<P>
