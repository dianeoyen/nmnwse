<P>
It's that time again--time for us to network, get to know one another--and this time--celebrate a successful Expanding Your Horizons Conference.  No other formal presentations planned.  Just fun!!

<P>
If you can join us for <a href="http://nmnwse.org/ceyh/"">EYH on Saturday, March 14</a> -- we desperately need some volunteers!  It is only from 7:00 until 1:00, but if you only have  a couple of hours to spare that day--we'll take 'em!  Please contact me directly if you can support EYH at jeanne.banks@comcast.net or 505-239-2403.

<P>
Slate Street Cafe is located between 5th and 6th Sts, one block North of Lomas.  We will be ordering from the menu, so everyone can choose what they would like.

<P>
Please come--I would love to see everone!
