<B>November 2010 Central Chapter Update
</B>


<P>
The January Central Chapter Dinner will be held on January 11, 2010.  While the time and location are not yet set, there is some exciting news: We will bestow our 2009 IMPACT! Award on Joan Woodard at the Central Chapter Meeting on Monday evening, January 11, 2010.  I am looking for a very special location, and further details will be posted as available. 


<P>
Hope to see you there, 
<br><br>
Jeanne  Banks, for the Central Chapter
