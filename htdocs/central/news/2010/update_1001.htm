<P>
The January Central Chapter Dinner was a special event as we awarded Joan Woodard our coveted IMPACT! Award that evening.

<P>
I'm not sure I'll have time to schedule a central chapter dinner in March as
the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/ceyh">Albuquerque EYH</a> on April 3 will be rapidly approaching -- 
I hope you all have considered volunteering. 

<P>
I look forward to seeing you at the next Central Chapter Event!
<! Hope to see you there,  >
