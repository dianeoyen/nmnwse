<B>July 2010 Central Chapter Update
</B>


<P>
Hi Central Chapter--

<P>
I didn't want the summer to pass by without a get-together!  Hope everyone has been having a great summer.

<P>
Our August meeting will be at Ellen Evans' home<sup>*</sup> on Wednesday, August 11 at 6:00 PM.  She has graciously invited us back again.
There will be a cold buffet served with wine, beer and softer drinks.  Cost is $10 per person. 

<P>
I would like for someone who is coming to share what they are doing in their work with the group.  Please let me know if you would like to do so.

<P>
Please RSVP to me, and I hope to see you on the 11th!
<! I look forward to seeing you at the next Central Chapter Event! >
<! Hope to see you there,  >
<br><br>
Jeanne  Banks, for the Central Chapter
