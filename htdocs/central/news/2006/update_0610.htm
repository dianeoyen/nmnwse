<B>Oct 2006 Central Chapter Update</b>
 
<P>
Twenty-nine excited women attended the <a href="update_0608.htm">Wine Tasting event</a> on August 22!  It was a resounding success!
We had quality networking time and a chance to discuss the future activities of the Central Chapter, and representatives from Honeywell International presented us with a big check to support EYH.  Thanks to all who were there!  A special welcome to those of you who joined NMNWSE that evening.
 
<P>
Based on the results of the survey that was taken that evening, the group would like to meet six times
per year, every other month, at a dinner meeting.  The formal meetings will begin in January 2007.  During November, however, another purely social event will be held-probably the week of the 27th.  Stand by for news of both of these events.
