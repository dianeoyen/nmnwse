Dear NMNWSE Central Chapter Members and Soon-to-Be Members (I hope):
 
<P>
Please mark your calendars for a wonderful evening of RE-acquainting, RE-newing, RE-creating, and RE-juvenating the Central
Chapter of the New Mexico Network for Women in Science and Engineering!!  It is <b>Tuesday, August 22</b> at the <b>St Clair Winery &amp; Bistro</b>
on Rio Grande starting at <b>5:30pm</b>.  We won't start the wine tasting until after 6:00 so don't worry if you cannot be there
right at 5:30.

<P>
Many of you are already Network members and I am sure you will enjoy seeing old friends and meeting new ones.  Those of you
are not yet members--I know you will want to meet women like yourselves--interested in networking and supporting women in
their technical careers.  NMNWSE has many initiatives that you will learn about, especially the Expanding Your Horizons
conferences.
 
<P>
There will be a great deal of information to share, six wines to taste, wonderful munchies--and a whole lot of fun!!  More
details about this exciting event will be coming in the next few days.  Put it in your Palm right away!!  Also--pass it on
to your colleagues and friends.

<P>
Jeanne  Banks, for the Central Chapter
