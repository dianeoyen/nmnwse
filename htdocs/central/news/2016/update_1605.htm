<P>
Let's take the summer off and determine what we might want to do in the future.  The current plan of meeting every other month has not gotten a great deal of interest.  Look for a survey in the next few months that will allow you to provide input about future meetings.
<P>
Thanks to all for your interest in STEM and NMNWSE.  Have a great summer!

<P> The March Central Chapter meeting was held on March 15, 2016, at Mimi's Cafe in Albuquerque.
Dana Roberson, who has extensive experience in geologic exploration (among her many accomplishments), presented a very interesting talk on <b><I>"Downtown Albuquerque from a Geologic Point of View"</I></b> -- a walking tour (in pictures) of the geologic resources viewable in and on buildings in Albuquerque, focusing on the stones
used in construction which are primarily from New Mexico and which contribute greatly to the attractiveness of the skyline.
<br><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_dot.gif" height=10> 
 Dana created a map showing the locations discussed in the talk. If anyone wants to see the "geology" for themselves, please contact Jeanne Banks for a copy of the map.
