<P> The next Central Chapter meeting will be on March 15, 2016, at Mimi's Cafe in Albuquerque, on the west side of I-25 just north of Jefferson (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=to:4316%20THE%2025%20WAY,ALBUQUERQUE,87109&z=12">map</a>), from 6:00p - 7:30p.
This is a new location, and we hope it will prove to work well for Central Chapter meetings.
We will be in a private room.  Unlike Flying Star, we will order at the table. 
</P>
<P>
Our March speaker will be <b>Dana Roberson</b>:
Dana will present <b><I>"Downtown Albuquerque from a Geologic Point of View"</I></b> -- a walking tour (in pictures) of the geologic resources viewable in and on buildings in Albuquerque.
</p><p><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The building materials used in the construction of downtown Albuquerque contribute greatly to the attractiveness of the skyline and to the artistic detail encountered on close inspection. The dimension stone identified and discussed in this presentation is on building exteriors which any one can see at any time and any day of the week. 
Among the stone material used in downtown Albuquerque are sandstone, limestone, travertine, granite, gneiss and marble.  The various shades of red, brown, and yellow in the sandstone, commonly composed of the mineral quartz (SiO2), are caused by iron oxides. Stone used downtown comes primarily from New Mexico but some come from as far away as Canada, Wisconsin and California. 
<br><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_dot.gif" height=10> 
 Locations in this discussion will be listed on a map of downtown Albuquerque if anyone wants to see the "geology" for themselves.  
</p><p><b>Speaker bio:</b>&nbsp;Dana has twenty plus years' experience in geologic exploration; software engineering, analysis, development, and implementation; multiple systems engineering methodologies; software quality assurance; and project management. She has performed project, process, and software assessments with experience and training in software process methodology and project management. She also has line management experience, leading teams of software engineers, developers, and operations maintenance personnel.
</p><p>We hope you can join us for Dana's talk!
