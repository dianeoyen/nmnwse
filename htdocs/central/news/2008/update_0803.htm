Please join us for a little "March Madness"--Network Style!  We will be celebrating our successful Expanding Your Horizons Conference that is on March 15, plus hearing from Diane Albert about her exciting career in Patent Law.

<P>
We are going to break in a new, wonderful venue, Woody's Sports Cafe.  It is located just north of Burlison on Wyoming (noting the map has the arrow incorrectly just south of the intersection), across from the Albuquerque Academy Gate. If coming from the south on Wyoming, it is best to turn left on Burlison and then into the parking lot.  The restaurant is directly ahead.  If coming from the north, just turn into the parking lot from Wyoming.  We will order from the menu.
