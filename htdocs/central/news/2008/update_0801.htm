Happy 2008!  This month we are focusing our attention on the upcoming Expanding Your Horizons conference.  We will get an update on the progress/needs of the EYH Team from conference co-chairs, LeAnn Brasure and Kelly Collins.  Plus we will be helping with an important task. (Notice the stapler.....)  We will be stuffing and putting labels on the mailing envelopes for the conference brochures.

<P>
Supper will be catered, but informal (read that to mean paper plates!)  The cost will be between $12-$15.

<P>
CDM is on the 2nd floor, turn right when you get off the elevator.
We will be in Kelly's office. If you have any difficulties finding it, you can call me at 505-239-2403 for help (or call Kelly directly if you have her number).

<P>
<B>Please RSVP to me at 505-239-2403 (c), or Jeanne.Banks @ comcast.net</b>.
