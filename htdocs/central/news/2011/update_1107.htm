<B>July 2011 Central Chapter Update</b>

<P>
Hi Central Chapter--
<P>
Hope everyone has been having a great summer.
<P>
Our next Central Chapter Dinner is scheduled for Wednesday, August 10 at 6:00 PM at Ellen Evans' home.
There will be a cold buffet served with wine, beer and softer drinks.  Cost $10 per person.
If you did not receive the e-vite and need location information or directions, please contact me.
<P>
In addition to renewing our connections--this meeting will also be our opportunity to wish Betsy Frederick a fond good bye. She is moving east to be near her grandchildren.  Please join us to send Betsy off with a warm New Mexico--Vaya con Dios!
<P>
Hope to see you there!<br><br>
