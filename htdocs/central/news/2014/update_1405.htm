<P>
There will be a meeting each month for next several months to give everyone a chance to come and enjoy networking with some great women in science and hear about the inspiring work that they do.  
So far, they've all been great presentations!
<! In April, we heard from Dr. Laura Crossey of UNM's Department of Earth and Planetary Science.  It was a great presentation! >  
The day to remember is the 3rd Wednesday of each month, so mark <! May 21, June 18, > July 16 and August 20 on your calendars.
 
<P>
We are meeting in downtown Albuquerque at The Flying Star at 723 Silver Ave SW from 6:30p - 8:30p.  Each person simply goes through the line downstairs to order what they would like for dinner, then comes upstairs to the meeting room.  The wait staff deliver your meal to the meeting room.
 
<P>
I would like to utilize the on-line Evite application to deliver the meeting notices each month so you can let us know if you are planning to attend. We want to make sure we have reserved a large enough room!  You do not need an Evite account to reply to an invitation. Evite also allows you to include any guests that you are bringing or you can send them the invitation by simply using the Invite More button.  If I only have .gov or a .mil email address for you, please send me your home email as Evite is not allowed through the government and military firewalls. I plan to get the first Evite out in the next few days.
 
<P>
<! This month's speaker is still TBD -  >
Suggestions for speakers and other input for Central Chapter meeting planning are being solicited. Please email your suggestions to me, or use the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/central/contact_central.htm">"contact central" form</a>.

<P>
All the best,<br>
