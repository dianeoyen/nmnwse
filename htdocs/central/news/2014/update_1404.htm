Dr. Laura Crossey's research and academic interests include:
Aqueous and Sedimentary Geochemistry. Applications of low-temperature geochemistry to problems in hydrochemistry, sedimentary diagenesis, and geomicrobiology. My research approach combines field examination of modern early diagenetic environments (biogeochemistry of water and sediments) with laboratory analysis as well as core and outcrop evaluations applied to evaluate paleohydrology and reservoir/aquifer characteristics. Activities include geoscience outreach, K-12 outreach, and science education research as well as programs to increase the participation of under-represented groups in the science disciplines.
