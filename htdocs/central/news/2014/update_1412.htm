<P> <B>MEETING CANCELLED DIE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS! </B>

<P>
There will be no speaker at this month's Central Chapter meeting -- just networking among ourselves.
<br><br>
In the spirit of the season, We ask that you bring 
non-perishable food items that we will deliver on behalf of the chapter to Roadrunner Food Bank.
We are also asking you to consider bringing an item that can go in our "EYH goodies box" for raffling off to students or teachers who attend the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/ceyh/">Albuquerque EYH conference</a> next February.
<br><br>
And we may have a small surprise for you to thank you for your generousity!   
</P>
