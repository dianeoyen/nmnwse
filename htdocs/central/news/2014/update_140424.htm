<B>late April 2014 Central Chapter Update</b>


<P> At the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/central/news/2014/update_1404.htm">April central chapter meeting</a>, Dr. Laura Crossey gave a very interesting talk on her studies of the geology of the Grand Canyon, stressing what study of the "Upper World" vs "Lower World" waters (replenished by rain vs coming from the depths) can tell us about the formation and geologic history of the canyon.  She also touched on her and her department's pivotal role in planning and installing the <a href="http://tot.unm.edu/">"Trail of Time"</a> which opened in 2010 near 
the Verkamps Visitor Center on the south rim to educate visitors on the geology of the Grand Canyon. 

<P> In the networking discussion following the talk, we decided to try to hold meetings every month on the 3rd Wednesday, with occasional meetings at other times to accomodate those who have a standing conflict.
If you have suggestions for speakers, or would like to provide other input for central chapter meeting planning, please email me or use the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/central/contact_central.htm">"contact central" form</a>.
