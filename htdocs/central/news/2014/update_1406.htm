<tr><td valign="top">Abstract:</td>
  <td> Growing in up in NM gave me several opportunities to explore science, but it wasn't until I got involved in high school a student internship at Sandia National Laboratories that my interest in chemistry really took off.  I will share my experiences of "growing up" scientifically at a National Laboratory and how it has shaped my career, influenced the type of research I conduct, and the outreach I volunteer in. My research  supports the viability of alternative energy (marine hydrokinetic, solar) and homeland security (radiation detectors).
