With the busy summer coming to an end soon, I wanted to alert you to the next several meetings.  These dates are the 3rd Wednesday of each month, so mark Sep 17, Oct 15, Nov 19 and Dec 17 on your calendars.  The speakers will be announced as soon as possible.  If you would like to be a speaker and share your inspiring work with us, please contact Phyllis Baca at 505-490-1557 or plbaca@gmail.com.

We are going to continue to meet in downtown Albuquerque at The Flying Star at 723 Silver Ave SW from 6:30p - 8:30p.  Each person simply goes through the line downstairs to order what they would like for dinner, then comes upstairs to the meeting room.  The wait staff deliver your meal to the meeting room.

Another event that I hope you will consider is the Annual Meeting of the Network on October 17-19 in Las Vegas, NM.  The complete meeting agenda and information, plus a registration form, should be posted by Aug 25 on the NMNWSE website, <a href="http://nmnwse.org/">www.nmnwse.org</a>.
 
<P>
I would like to continue to utilize the on-line Evite application to deliver the meeting notices each month so you can let us know if you are planning to attend, so we can make sure we have reserved a large enough room! If you are not currently receiving Central Chapter Evites and would like to, or would like to
suggest speakers or give other input for Central Chapter meeting planning, please email me, or use the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/central/contact_central.htm">"contact central" form</a>.

<P>
All the best,<br>
Jeanne  Banks, for the Central Chapter
