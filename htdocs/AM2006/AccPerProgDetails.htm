<P> We hope you will want to join us for the wine and cheese reception Friday during registration (6-8:30 pm) and the telescope viewing after 8:30 PM both nights (weather permitting). 

<P> We also hope you will stay for the after dinner speaker on Saturday (starting at 7 PM). Cynthia is an archaeologist and director of the museum at Western New Mexico University, and will talk on the ancient Mimbres culture which left many archeologic sites in the area. Some of the slides Cynthia
will be showing are from excavations she conducted at the Lake Roberts Vista
site, not too far from Spirit Canyon Lodge. The Lodge owner has heard her speak and says Cynthia puts on a good show.


<P> <img SRC="http://nmnwse.org/lawis/Images/r_hand.gif"> <B>We have a special afternoon guided hike just for accompanying persons scheduled on Saturday.</B> 

<P>The hike will be led by local archeologist Marilyn Markel, a fantastic local professional archaeologist who works closely with the US Forest Service and the Nature Conservancy. Marilyn will emphasize the local archaeology, geology, and botany. 

<P>
There will be a $10 additional fee for those going on the hike to cover costs.
It will be a 2-3 hour moderate hike, and no facilities will be available while you are away from the lodge.  Study shoes and layered clothing appropriate to the weather are recommended. Snacks and water bottles to take with you on the hike will be put out immediately after lunch, and you are welcome to borrow the binoculars we are bringing for the night sky viewing.

<P>
There are many wonderful sites within 7 miles of Lodge. Marilyn will meet the hikers at the lodge at 1:30, go over the options, and then you will carpool (in your own cars) to the destination of your choice.

<P> You will be back at the lodge no later than 5PM, when the techical sessions end. Dinner starts at 6PM, so you'll have at least an hour back at the Lodge before dinner starts.
