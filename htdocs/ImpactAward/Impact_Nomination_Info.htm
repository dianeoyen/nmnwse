<P align="justify">The <B>New Mexico Network for Women in Science and Engineering</B> began in 1975 with a core group of faculty and staff from UNM wanting to reach out to women in science as a group. Incorporated in 1979, the Network works to encourage and help women enter and succeed in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) careers and promote networking and communication among members by providing regularly scheduled meetings, talks and other local activities. About 1000 teens each year attend our technical career workshops. Our Annual Meeting and Technical Symposium provides members an opportunity to present technical papers in a supportive environment as well as professional development and networking opportunities.

In 1974 the <B>NM Commission on the Status of Women</B> was created by state statute to increase the knowledge of the rights, responsibilities and interests of women and girls in New Mexico and to preserve women's history and contributions to our state. The office is charged with conducting statewide studies on the status of women, acting as a clearinghouse and referral service on issues impacting women, recommending methods to overcome discrimination against women, promoting methods for women to develop their skills and continue their education, hosting periodic statewide conferences for women, collaborating with other entities working with women and securing recognition for women's accomplishments and contributions to New Mexico. 
The Commission was terminated by Governor Martinez in 2011.
