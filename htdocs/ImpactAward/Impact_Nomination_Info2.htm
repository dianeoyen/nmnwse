<P align="justify">
<B>IMPACT! Award</b> judges use the following weighting system as a guide for 
assessing and ranking the quality of the nominees. Candidates are judged 
on the merits indicated in the submitted nomination packet as NMNWSE 
does not have the resources to solicit additional supporting materials. 
Please insure your packet is as strong as your nominee's <B>IMPACT!</b>  In 
particular, be sure to include three letters of recommendation so 
your nominee does not lose out simply due to lack of supporting letters. 
If you have any questions regarding the nomination or judging process, 
contact NMNWSE <B>IMPACT! Award</B> Chair or NMNWSE Board.
Thank you for taking the time to nominate one of the many outstanding 
New Mexico women whose <B>IMPACT!</B> deserves recognition.
