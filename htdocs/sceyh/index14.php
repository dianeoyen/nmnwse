<P><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/button.gif" height=12><b>February 24, 2014 update:</b> Our 2014 EYH was a great success.  We had over 200 girls attend including some who speak Spanish only.  While we had some glitches with registration this year, we were amazed by the creativity and resilience of our volunteers to resolve this issue quickly by working together.  That was so wonderful.  And it seemed that we were able to stay on schedule too.  The girls seemed well behaved and seemed to really enjoy!!!!  
<br>
<b>Thanks to all who helped make this EYH a success!</b>
