<P ALIGN="CENTER">HONEYWELL ENGINEERS WIN R&amp;D 100 AWARD FOR CONCRETE ANALYSIS</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ALBUQUERQUE &#151; Three Honeywell Federal Manufacturing and Technologies engineers have been presented with a prestigious R&amp;D 100 Award for 2001.  The engineers, Chris Baumgart, Ph.D, Kim Linder, Ph.D, and Steven Cave were instrumental in developing an electronic imaging process to scan concrete samples, calculating 16 microscopical properties with precision to 1/2 micron. The work was accomplished in partnership with the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT).</P>

<P>In the past, MoDOT performed manual concrete evaluations to determine the quality of newly laid concrete and to examine concrete degradation due to aging. The hardened Portland cement concrete specifications were measured and characterized in a laborious and time-intensive evaluation process assessing the quality of newly laid concrete and examining concrete degradation due to aging.</P>

<P>The automated process detects void spaces in the concrete as small as two microns in size and measures 15 other criteria.  The repeatability of the scanning and evaluation process added to the technology's standardization merit.</P>

<P>"It is exciting to be involved in a project that wins an R&amp;D 100 award.&nbsp; I thought our team worked very well together at facing the technical challenges and coming out with a workable solution,&quot; said Staff Engineer Linder.&nbsp; &quot;Throughout this project I learned more about Portland Cement and concrete than I ever thought I would!"</P>

<P>Cave, a Technical Project Specialist added, &quot;This is a success story for the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement process that allows application of DOE technology to &#133; commercial and industrial environments.  We are hopeful that the system will be adopted by other state DOTs or testing laboratories in the near future."</P>

<P>The R&amp;D 100 Award is a nearly 40 year old competition sponsored by <I>R&amp;D Magazine</I> and dedicated to recognizing the 100 most technologically significant products of the year.  Awards are given for products and processes that can change people&#146;s lives for the better, improve the standard of living for large numbers of people, promote good health, and clean up the environment.</P>
