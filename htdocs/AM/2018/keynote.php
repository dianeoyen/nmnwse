        Advancing Women in STEM through Institutional Transformation
      </h2>

      <p>
        Programs aimed at increasing women in STEM fields frequently focus on providing extra resources and support for women students, faculty or employees. These efforts are important, but insufficient, as they do not address underlying policies and practices that may need to change in order for lasting progress to occur. ADVANCE at UNM is currently beginning the third year of a five-year National Science Foundation-funded ADVANCE Institutional Transformation grant focused on recruitment, retention and advancement of women and minority STEM faculty through a combination of institutional changes, professional development resources and individual faculty support. After an introduction to the current status of women STEM faculty at research universities in general and UNM specifically, Iâ€™ll present some examples of ADVANCE at UNM experiences, successes and challenges that are relevant beyond academic settings.  Examples will include increasing diversity in job applicant pools, addressing implicit bias in evaluations, identifying policies that are misunderstood or inappropriately applied, and finding ways to frame issues that can foster unexpected collaborations.
