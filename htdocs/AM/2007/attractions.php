The campus was built as a WPA project in the 1930's in Pueblo Revival architectural style. A special room is dedicated to the handmade furniture, hand woven drapes, iron and copper work of many Union County residents who built the school. Thirty-six easel paintings by well-known NM artists are also on view. This collection constitutes the only WPA museum in the state.</I>
