<br>I am an undergraduate majoring in mathematics, computer science, and applied studies at NMSU.   Although I am a student, I am active in the southern chapter.  I helped revitalize the southern chapter and am working on expanding the NMNWSE to NMSU students and high school students.  I am running for VP because I think the experience would be good.

I became a professor at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee where I was the Science Education Specialist. I was very active in the UW System Women & Science Program (= Board Member 1997-2005, Co-Chair for 2 years and presented numerous presentations & workshops at our meetings). I was also the UWM Representative to the Committee on Institution Cooperation Women in Science & Engineering consortium (CIC WISE). I became a professor at UNM Valencia Campus so I could devote more of my efforts to enhancing teaching and learning. NMNWSE Board member 2006.
