If you are considering attending but are not ready to <a href="register">register</a>, please complete the &nbsp;<a href="survey/">online Interest Survey</a>. It does not register you or obligate you to attend - it is simply to help us with advance planning to insure a good conference for all. 
The &nbsp;<a href="survey/">survey</a> also includes a checkbox to indicate if you are interested in serving on the 2008 NMNWSE board, which will be elected at the Annual Meeting.

<P>
If you will be attending, we recommend making your room reservations as as soon as possible, as space in the conference hotel is limited - see the <a href="hotel.php">Hotel Reservations page</a> for the Conference Hotel contact info and overflow suggestions.
