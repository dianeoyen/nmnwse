The Lodge has 7 rooms with two twins each, and 1 room with a king bed - the twins can also be combined to make kings.
Each set of rooms shares a bathroom, and each opens to the outside. The center of the lodge is a great room where the meeting will be held.

Views from the Lodge. We are allowed to walk in the nearby area (limited to 300 meters radius), and accompanying persons are encouraged to take advantage of this during the meeting.
As past season, no van tours or longer hikes on the Preserve are possible. See <a href="attractions.php">area attractions</a> for suggestions of actitivites in the surrounding national forest and nearby communities.

<b>Be sure to bring warm clothes</b> and plan to dress in layers, as snowstorms are possible in October, but it can also be warm and sunny.

<P>
<B>Note the Preserve is otherwise closed during the meeting, so if there are any changes in your planned arrival from what you indicated on the registration form your will need to let the meeting registrar know, re opening the gate.</b> There is cell phone service at the Lodge, so if there are last minute changes you can also call Tinka (505-690-1318) when you arrive to get the gate open, with the caveat that the cell phone reception at the Lodge is spotty so it is best if we know to be watching for a call.
