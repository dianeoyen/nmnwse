-->

<P><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_pin.gif">If you would like to let us know if your interest in coming but are not ready to register, please use the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/survey">Interest Survey</a>.

<br><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_pin.gif"> You should receive an emailed acknowledgment from the registrar indicating we received your online registration within two business days after clicking the "<font size="-1">SUBMIT FORM</font>" button at the bottom of the registration form.  
If you do not, there may have been server, software, or spam-filter problems preventing our receiving your online registration - the hardcopy mailed with your check suffices (which is why we ask it be included), but we would appreciate your <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2010/contacts.php">contacting the AM2010 Registrar</a> to give us a heads-up if you do not receive an acknowledgement in a timely fashion. (This is especially important if you requested a scholarship and so are waiting to hear from us before mailing a check.)

<P>
<B>If you have any questions please contact the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2010/contacts.php">AM2010 Registrar or appropriate Meeting Chair</a>.</b> 
Also, the Preserve is otherwise closed during the meeting and so you will need to coordinate your arrival and departure with the meeting registrar so the gate can be opened.

<a name="techpres">

<P>
Technical presentations on any topic in science and engineering (broadly defined to include most other fields), as well as presentations on other topics which may be of interest to women working in these fields, are welcome. Due to the limited time available for talks, poster presentations are preferred. If more talk submissions are received than time allows, the Technical Chair may relegate some talks to posters. If your employer requires you to give a talk in order to be reimbursed for attending, please specify that in the abstracts section.

<P>Post-deadline technical abstracts (ones submitted after Sep 10, 2010) may be relegated to
the poster session even if you indicate you prefer to give a talk - contact the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2010/contacts.php">Technical Chair</a> for scheduling of your
presentation.

<P>
Note students and members with exceptional circumstances are eligible to apply for a meeting scholarship (<a href="#scholarship">details below</a>).

Although slightly reduced rates are offered for attendees who can only attend the technical portion, all attendees are encouraged to come for the full meeting. Registration includes meals and snacks as there are no concession options available in the Preserve. (A receipt with food listed as a seperate cost can be provided if required by your employer.)

A reduced rate is offered for those who will only join us Saturday all day (except breakfast), or Saturday after lunch. 
<b>Accompanying children</b> (11 and under) only need to be included on the registration form if they will be eating with us (the only option on the Preserve), and can partake of all food for the "just conference dinner" price (free for children 3 and under, but please still indicate the number on the form to insure we have food for them). 
Accompanying persons 18 and under are welcome to attend the technical sessions at no charge (if interested). 
Accompanying adults over 18 wishing to attend the business meeting or technical talks would need to register as attendees; however, accompanying adults coming to the conference dinner may come to the poster session/pre-dinner reception without registering as attendees. 
If you select any "3+" persons option in the conference fees section, please use the accompanying person name field or the comment box at the end of the registration form to specify actual number(s), and multiply by the actual number(s) of people to obtain the total.

<P>
<b>Lunch and Breakfast are on your own.</b> A Continental breakfast is included with rooms at the Hacienda Vargas Bed and Breakfast (conference hotel). 
There are several places to purchase lunch in the neighborhood.

<P><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/button.gif" height="12"><B>SCHOLARSHIP NOTES</b><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/button.gif" height="12"> 
<a name="scholarship">

<P>Students, and members with exceptional circumstances, can apply for a meeting scholarship to cover costs.
The application process is simple: check the box on the registration form indicating you want to apply
for a scholarship, and provide a brief justification in the space provided (e.g., "student presenting paper" is sufficient for student applicants) -
we will contact you if more information is needed. 

<P>Scholarships are awarded based on need and whether
presenting a paper in the technical session. The scholarship covers the conference registration, receptions, and conference dinner.
In exceptional circumstances we may be able to provide full scholarships to cover lodging, all meals, and some transportation - please indicate in the justification if you
feel your circumstances justify a full scholarship. You can also contact the 
<a href="mailto:NMNWSE_Board-l@list.unm.edu ?Subject=NMNWSE AM2010 Scholarship">NMNWSE Board</a> or the
<a href="../contacts.php">Technical Chair</a> for more information on our scholarship policy.


<P>If applying for a scholarship, after submitting the online registration form, please wait to send any payment for your conference fees until you have heard from the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2010/contacts.php">meeting registrar</a> as to your scholarship status. Only send payment after the registrar has let you know your remaining balance after subtracting the scholarship award. Please give us at least one week to review your request. 
If you do not receive an email from the registrar acknowledging your online registration was received within two business days of submitting, or you do not hear within one week as to your scholarship status, or if you have questions, please <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2010/contacts.php">contact us</a>. 

<P>We understand that some applying for scholarships may not be able to attend the meeting without it, and if your application is not approved we will not assess any penalities for cancelling your registration. We also encourage any who might fall into this category to indicate that on their application as a hardship consideration is part of our decision process. 


<P><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/button.gif" height="12"><B>ACCOMMODATIONS NOTES</b><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/button.gif" height="12">

<P>
Housing at the Preserve is limited and no direct individual room reservations are possible. Hence spaces will be assigned on a first-come, first served basis
and we encourage you to reserve your accommodations early. 
Also, the Preserve is otherwise closed during the meeting and so you will need to coordinate your arrival and departure with the meeting registrar so the gate can be opened.

The Lodge has 8 double rooms (2 twins, or king). The Bunkhouse has one "single" room (queen bed could be added), and two rooms with 6 beds each (6 single, or 2 full plus 2 single). 
<a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2010/AM2010_AccomodationsLayout.pdf">Click here for a sketch of the room layout.</a>
See also the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2010/hotel.php">conference hotel page</a> 
for more information. 

<P>
For those indicating they wish to stay at the Preserve (both Friday and Saturday nights - we are not offering a 1-night option),
the registrar will contact you in the order you registered to let you choose from remaining spaces. Adjustments to the registration fee to reflect actual lodging received vs desired preference indicated on the registration form will be made at the meeting.
Pets are not allowed.
<P>
Note the accomodations are reserved "per bed space", not "per room", so if you wish a room alone you will either need to be the first to request the one single, or pay for all bed spaces in the room of your choice - as bed space is limited we do not encourage this option. When the registrar contacts you, if your party does not fill a room you will be asked about roommate preferences - you can also specify that in the comment section on the registration form. 

<P>Note that if we do not have 
sufficient registration we may also have to cancel the bunkhouse - if the bunkhouse is cancelled, will will do our best to help any affected persons find suitable alternate accomodations, or refund their registration in full.


<P>
If you will not be staying on the Preserve, see the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2010/hotel.php">conference hotel page</a> for suggestions for housing in the nearby communities. Don't forget you will need to coordinate arrival and departure times to/from the Preserve with the meeting registrar as the Preserve gate is otherwise locked. 

<P>The Lodge is at 8800 feet, and snow is not uncommon in October. Hopefully we'll have beautiful warm fall days and cool clear nights, but freezing temperatures or a blizzard is also possible.  <B>Please plan to dress accordingly.</b>

<P><b>Room Sharing / Carpooling:</b> We plan to send emails out to those who check these boxes basically saying "The people on this email expressed interest in sharing a room/carpooling. Contact each other." The Registrar will take standard measures to insure all that the email goes out only to those who have a legitimate meeting-related interest. However, if you do not wish us to share your contact information with others who are similarly interested in a sharing a room or carpooling, be sure to indicate that in the comments section, or just don't check these boxes.

<P><b>Scholarship applicants:</b> 
We are holding some of the less expensive spaces in the bunkhouse for scholarship recipients, although we still recommend you register early as we may have to release these as the deadlines approach. 
<!--
we have pre-reserved an inexpensive room for use by scholarship recipients - contact the <a href="../contacts.php">Meeting Chair</a>, rather than the hotel, about this room.

<P>
The comment box at the bottom of the form or the <a
href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/survey">interest survey</a> may be used if you would like to provide further details on your preferences.
In particular, if you have dietary restrictions or need special accomodations, please us the comment box let us know your needs.
You may also use the comment box to provide any other feedback you wish to give.

<P>
As the Valles is closed during the meeting, we do not currently plan to offer any organized activites for accompanying persons during the meeting. We will have at least one telescope, and walking within a 300 meter radius is allowed - this includes the history grove. 
However, if sufficient interest in an accompanying person program is indicated, 
we will try and provide some organized activity highlighting this unique setting, and in any case will try to provide suggestions for things to do in the surrounding area for accompanying persons who wish to leave the Preserve while we are meeting. 
<!--
If any organized activities are offered, you will pay for these at the meeting.
No organized will be planned unless sufficient interest is indicated, although we'll try to provide some activity suggestions in any case.
