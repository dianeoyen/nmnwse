The 2008 NMNWSE Annual Meeting and Technical Symposium will take place
at the Sierra Grande Lodge and Spa in Truth or Consequences, NM.
This region of New Mexico, with its unique and restorative hot springs, has long been considered a sacred place of healing. Sierra Grande offers a sanctuary for rejuvenation, fine southwestern accommodations, a wide array of massage and spa treatments, and soothing mineral baths.
