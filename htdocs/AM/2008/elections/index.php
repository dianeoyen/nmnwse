<b>Message from the Elections Chair:</b>

<P>
Due to minimal response, the Elections Chair has opted to move the following sparse slate to be elected by acclamation at the annual meeting. There were no objections from the Board.  <br>
<br>
Treasurer:<br>
Yolanda King<br>
<br>
Members-at-large:<br>
Dana Roberson<br>
Donna Senft
</P>
<P>
Note we have NO new Vice-President (President-elect). Someone is encouraged to volunteer for this position at any time over the next year, including AT the annual meeting (where an election by acclamation could occur).
</P>
<P>
If you would potentially be interested in serving on the board or would like to suggest someone who might, 
please contact me and/or the NMNWSE Board if you will not be at the Annual Meeting.
Descriptions of board member responsibilities and other information can be found on the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/Board.php">Board web pages</a>.
You'll see all the standing committees posted <a href="http://nmnwse.org/Board.php">there</a>, too. Please consider getting involved in one of these areas - we can always use more help!
</P>
<P>
Sincerely,
<br>
Georgia A. Pedicini, NMNWSE elections chair
