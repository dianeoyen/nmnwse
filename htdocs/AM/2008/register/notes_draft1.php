<P><B>CONFERENCE FEES NOTES</b>

<P>
<B>Attendee registration</b> for the full meeting includes a Friday evening reception, snacks during the meeting, the wine and cheese reception during the poster session, and the conference dinner, plus covering our facilities costs. Although slightly reduced rates are offered for attendees who can only attend the technical portion, all attendees are encouraged to come for the full meeting. 

<P>
<B>Accompanying adult</b> registration for the full meeting includes the Friday evening reception, the wine and cheese reception during the poster session, and the conference dinner. AAreduced rate is offered for those who will only join us Saturday evening. <b>Accompanying children</b> are also welcome to attend the Friday evening reception at no charge, but only need to be included on the registration form if they will be at the Saturday reception and dinner (even if under 4 so free, as we need to give the count to the caterer). Accompanying minors (18 and under) are welcome to attend the technical sessions at no charge (if interested). Accompanying adults over 18 wishing to attend the business meeting or technical talks would need to register as attendees; however, accompanying adults registered for dinner may come to the poster session/pre-dinner reception without registering as attendees. 

<P>
If you select any "4+" persons option in the conference fees section, please use the accompanying person name field or the comment box at the end of the registration form to specify actual number(s), and multiply by the actual number(s) of people to obtain the total.

<P>
Lunch and Breakfast are on your own. Food is available at the conference hotel and other nearby businesses (noting the Sierra Grande Lodge and Spa's website indicates their restaurant is teporarily closed, but they provide a list of local restaurants).<font color="red">CHECK IF EXPECTED TO BE OPEN BY OCT 24 and modify this sentence if needed.</font> 

<P><B>SCHOLARSHIP NOTES</b> 

<P>Students, and members with exceptional circumstances, can apply for a meeting scholarship to cover costs.
The application process is simple: check the box on the registration form indicting you want to apply
for a scholarship, and provide a brief justification in the space provided (e.g., "student presenting paper" is sufficient for student applicants) -
we will contact you if more information is needed. 

<P>Scholarships are awarded based on need and whether
presenting a paper in the technical session. The scholarship covers the conference registration, receptions, and conference dinner, as well as 2 nights lodging (shared room) at the Pelican Spa.
In exceptional circumstances we may be able to provide full scholarships to cover all meals and some transportation - please indicate in the justification if you
feel your circumstances justify a full scholarship. You can also contact the 
<a href="mailto:NMNWSE_Board-l@list.unm.edu ?Subject=NMNWSE AM2008 Scholarship">NMNWSE Board</a> or the
<a href="../contacts.php">Technical Chair</a> for more information on our scholarship policy.
<font color="red">IN PAST DIDN'T DO LODGING - does that need board OK?</font>


<P>If applying for a scholarship, please contact the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2008/contacts.php">meeting registrar</a> for scholarship status prior to sending a check for your conference fees - give us at least one week to review your request. 


<P><B>ACCOMMODATIONS NOTES</b>

<P>
<B>Accommodations are on your own.</B>
Please see the <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2008/hotel.php">conference hotel page</a> for hotel contact info, discounted meeting rates, and further details. Both the Sierra Grande Lodge and Spa and the nearby Pelican Spa are small, and so we encourage you to reserve your accomodations early.

<P>We must release any unsold rooms on C.O.B <b>15 Sep. 2008</b>. If you
do not make your hotel reservations before C.O.B. 15 Sep. 2008 and
desire accommodations, standard rates will apply to unsold rooms, if any, and we cannot guarantee rooms will be available at the conference hotel or nearby. 

<P><b>Room Sharing / Carpooling:</b> We plan to send emails out to those who check these boxes basically saying "The people on this email expressed interest in sharing a room/carpooling. Contact each other." The Registrar will take standard measures to insure all that the email goes out only to those who have a legitimate meeting-related interest. However, if you do not wish us to share your contact information with others who are similarly interested in a sharing a room or carpooling, be sure to indicate that in the comments section, or just don't check these boxes.

<P><b>Scholarship applicants:</b> we have pre-reserved an inexpensive room at the Pelican Spa with two twin beds for use by scholarship recipients - contact the <a href="../contacts.php">Meeting Chair</a>, rather than the hotel, about this room.

<P><B>PREFERENCES NOTES</b>

<P>
The comment box at the bottom of the form or the <a
href="http://nmnwse.org/AM/2008/survey">interest survey</a> may be used if you would like to provide further details on your preferences.

<P>
If any organized activities are offered, you will pay for these at the meeting.
No organized will be planned unless sufficient interest is indicated, although we'll try to provide some activity suggestions in any case.
