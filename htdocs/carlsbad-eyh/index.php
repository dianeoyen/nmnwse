<P><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_pin.gif">&nbsp; Similar to last year, we plan to have the girls bussed in to NMSU Carlsbad from the middle school. 

<P>
Our first EYH in 2014 was a learning experience: although attendance was low, both the girls and the presenters had a lot of fun, and there were exciting mentoring and networking interactions. 
Building on that experience, in 2015 we had 50 girls bussed in to the college from the 6th grade academy.
There were 15 workshops offered in 3 sessions followed by a lunch and guest speaker who is a physician.  The girls loved the opportunity! NMSU Carlsbad provides a wonderful environment, and we had many incredible volunteers, so we plan to continue with the model we used in 2015 as we work to improve the experience for the young women who attend our conference.

<P><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_pin.gif">&nbsp; 
We are actively looking for 2016 sponsors.
<br>
Besides our <a href="http://nmnwse.org/carlsbad-eyh/cbeyh_sponsors.php">previous sponsors</a>, we'd also like to thank <! the United Way and the Nuclear Waster Partnership, as well as > all the individual
AAUW members who volunteered their time and made small monetary donations. 

<P><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_pin.gif">&nbsp; Our ultimate goal to motivate girls to become innovative and creative thinkers ready to meet 21st Century challenges.
If you'd like to be involved in planning or are willing to be a presenter, or would like to sponsor or get additional information on this program, 
please contact Cassie at <a href="mailto:marrs.cassie@gmail.com?Subject=Carlsbad EYH">marrs.cassie@gmail.com</a>.
