<P>Computers are made up of hardware and software. The physical parts of
the computer, for example, the keyboard, printer, connectors, and chips,
are hardware. The software part of the computer is the collection of programs
that make the computers useful. A program is a set of instructions that
tells the computer how to perform a task such as how to play solitaire
or how to check the spelling of a story you write. Computer engineers design
and build computer hardware. Computer scientists (or software engineers)
write computer programs.

Computer Scientists who develop new algorithms benefit from having a solid math and science background. UNM Computer Science graduate student Diane Oyen works on coding graphical models that help scientists to understand complex data.  Much of her work involves analyzing fMRI brain imaging data to understand the effect of disease and treatment on the functional activation network of the brain.

<P>If you like to solve problems, you might become a successful computer
scientist or computer engineer. It is important to think logically and
to be able to break a problem up into its parts and to assemble a solution
from these parts. It is also important to pay attention to details; in
this field a small oversight can have disastrous consequences. These careers
also require good communication skills, which are used to define the problem
and to document your solutions.

scientist/engineer like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Both computer scientists and engineers work primarily in groups that
work together to define the problem, establish schedules, brainstorm the
solution, and document the results. An individual group member will be
responsible for one aspect of the problem. Computer engineers often spend
some part of their time in laboratories building and testing prototype
hardware devices. They may be responsible for overseeing manufacturing
of the actual devices. A computer scientist will do most of her programming
in an office using a computer workstation.

<P>In high school take a broad selection of challenging courses that make
you think. If possible, take mathematics classes including algebra, geometry,
and trigonometry. High school physics gives a good introduction to electricity,
which is the power behind computers. Don't forget to take courses that
emphasize communication, both writing and public speaking. After high school,
some two-year programs are available in computer electronics and computer
technology. Most colleges and universities offer four-year programs leading
to a degree in computer science and four- or five-year programs leading
to a degree in electrical engineering or computer engineering. These programs
require classes in mathematics, physics, and programming. Advanced degrees
are available for those interested in careers in advanced research or college
teaching.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Jobs for computer scientists and engineers are everywhere: in schools,
industry, government, and universities. Demand far exceeds supply, and
this condition will continue for many years. Currently, many well-paying, interesting
jobs require computer skills, and the more mathematics, computing, and
engineering courses you have taken, the more choices you will have.
