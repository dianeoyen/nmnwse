<P>Job experience in a technical field is an important part of your education
and can help you decide where your interests lie. Your success in getting
a summer job will be directly related to how you go about it.

<P>Before you even go out the front door, you should have a resume (see
the article on resumes). The actual preparation of a resume is covered
in a separate chapter. Very briefly, you should include your work experience,
your courses in school, your extracurricular activities and hobbies, and
your career objectives. Armed with a resume you can start your job hunt.

<P>Everyone you know is a potential source of employment. They may not
be in a position to hire you but may know of someone who is, so tell everybody
you know that you want a job. If people do not know your qualifications,
experience, and goals in life, tell them! It is perfectly all right to
say something like the following: "I am a junior in high school with a
B+ average. I have received A's in chemistry and math, and I am taking
calculus and advanced chemistry next year. When I start college, I am going
to major in electrical engineering." Remember that if you do not tell people
about yourself, no one else will do it for you.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>The best place to start</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The best place to start looking for the kind of summer job you want
is in the organizations that employ people who are doing what you want
to do. If you want to be a doctor, contact doctors' offices and medical
labs; if you want to be an architect, contact the architectural firms in
your city or town. Any experience or knowledge you can gain about the career
you want to enter will be helpful to you.

<P>The term "any experience" brings up the question: "What if they offer
me a job as a secretary or clerk?" Unless you have a better job offer,
take it, but make sure that everyone you work with knows that your goal
in life is to be an engineer, not a secretary. Ask questions about the
technical work of the organization, tell people that you want to learn
about what the organization does, and volunteer to help with drafting,
experiments, and all the other projects that the engineers and scientists
are doing. Ask them about their work, ask from what universities they graduated,
and what courses you should be taking in high school. People love to talk
about themselves and their jobs, so they will be glad to answer your questions.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>If you can't find a job</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>You may not be fortunate enough to find a paid summer job in the field
that interests you. If this happens, do not give up and spend the summer
in your back yard. Take courses, do volunteer work, spend time at the library;
do whatever you can to gain experience in the working world or to improve
your knowledge of scientific, engineering, and other nontraditional disciplines.
Although you may not receive a paycheck, you will get experience and knowledge
that may give you an edge in obtaining a job later.

employers.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>When do you start looking
for a summer job?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>"Now" is the answer. Once again, tell everyone you know (teachers, parents,
friends, and relatives) that you want a job and tell them what kind of
job you want. Contact the places where you wish to work and find out when
they start accepting applications for summer employment. The federal government,
for example, starts their summer employment program in November to fill
vacancies for the following summer. Be persistent and follow up on your
employment leads.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Don't get discouraged</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Almost no one gets a job at the first place they apply. Most people
have held jobs that were not exactly what they wanted. However, they learned
all they could and worked hard, and the experience they gained helped them
later to get a job they really wanted.
