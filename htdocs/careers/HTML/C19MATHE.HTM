<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a mathematician?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A mathematician uses numbers and symbols in many ways, from creating
new theories to translating scientific and technical problems into mathematical
terms. Some mathematicians are more focused on pure mathematics.&nbsp;
There are two types of developing mathematicians: the theoretical mathematician,
who works with pure mathematics to develop and discover new mathematical
principles and theories without regard to their possible application, and
the applied mathematician, who uses mathematical methods to solve practical
problems in such diverse areas as physics, astronomy, engineering, computer
science, biology, ecology, medicine, economics, and psychology. The
pure or theoretical mathematician is more likely to teach and do research
at universities or other research institutes, while the applied mathematician
is likely to work for business, government, or industry. Some mathematicians
have their own consulting firms.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good mathematician?</FONT></FONT></B>

<IMG SRC="C19_P1.GIF" align="right">
<P>According to Karl Weierstrass, a famous German mathematician,
"A mathematician who is not also something of a poet will never be a
complete mathematician."
A mathematician appreciates beauty, symmetry, and order
in nature and in logical and analytical thought. She should have a logical
mind, a sense of curiosity, the desire and ability to solve problems, and
numerical aptitude. A mathematician cannot be easily discouraged, for solving
research problems often requires months of work. Some mathematical problems
have remained unsolved for centuries. An applied mathematician must be
able to communicate effectively and bring structure and analytical rigor
to what is often a morass of confusing information. A mathematician, however,
need not be a genius; a desire to work hard and an ability to formulate
problems in mathematical terms is what makes a good mathematician.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a mathematician
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A mathematician's life is spent learning and discovering new principles
and using mathematics to formulate and solve problems. The tools of a mathematician,
whether she teaches in a university or works in a laboratory, government,
or private industry, are few in number: she needs a pencil (and an eraser!),
paper, sometimes a computer or calculator, a good library, and professional
colleagues. A mathematician rarely works completely alone. A theoretical
mathematician will discuss new theories with co-workers and learn from
their comments, and an applied mathematician will work closely with the
scientists, engineers, or other clients, who need a mathematician to help
solve problems in their fields. Besides communicating with co-workers and
clients, a mathematician reads mathematical and scientific publications,
attends national and international professional meetings here and abroad,
gives presentation talks about her work based on her research, writes technical
papers, and may teach. The love a mathematician has for her work and the
satisfaction she derives from it make her professional life stimulating
and rewarding.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a mathematician?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A future mathematician should take four years of mathematics in high
school, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and analytic geometry,
or precalculus (if it is offered, she should take calculus). In college,
she should take many theoretical math courses (calculus, algebra, real
and complex analysis, geometry, and differential equations), applied math
courses devoted to problem solving (probability, statistics, numerical
analysis, and computer science), and physical science courses (physics,
chemistry, and engineering). To widen her career options, she should acquire
a broad background not only in both pure and applied mathematics, but also in
the sciences such as physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. College
English composition classes are also invaluable; the ability to write clearly
and correctly is essential in any profession.

<P>A bachelor's degree with a major in mathematics is the minimum requirement
for starting positions in mathematics. To advance to higher-level positions
and do research or teach at the college level, a master's degree or a Ph.D.
is necessary. Most mathematicians seeking advanced degrees decide in graduate
school between pure and applied mathematics as their specialty.

Emmy Noether persisted in the face of tremendous obstacles to become one of the greatest algebraists of the 20th century.  The annual AWM Noether Lectures honor women who have made fundamental and sustained contributions to the mathematics. Profiles of past lecturers can be found at:

<P>The college graduate with a bachelor's degree in mathematics can qualify
for some positions in business, industry, government, and teaching. The
opportunities and the pay increase significantly with higher degrees. Companies
in the computer and communications industries employ many mathematicians
as do oil companies, banks, consulting firms, and insurance companies.
Almost every bureau and branch of the federal government employs mathematicians
in some capacity. Mathematicians work in universities and colleges, teaching
and doing research. In most four-year colleges and universities, the Ph.D.
is necessary for full faculty status. Many mathematicians with a master's
degree teach at the high school level.

<P>Many other job titles apply to mathematicians who have specialized in
an applied branch of mathematics. Actuaries assemble and analyze statistics
to calculate probabilities, and thereby set insurance rates. Operations
research analysts apply scientific methods and mathematical principles
to organizational problems. Statisticians design, carry out, and interpret
the numerical results of surveys and experiments. All of these careers
begin with an education in mathematics and a curiosity about the use of
mathematics to solve problems.
