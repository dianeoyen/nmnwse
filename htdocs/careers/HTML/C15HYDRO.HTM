<P>The job of the hydrologist is to solve problems of water quality, quantity,
and availability. Hydrologists study all of the physical, chemical, and
biological processes involving water as it travels its various paths over
and beneath the earth's crust. Trained hydrologists may have a wide variety
of job titles. Some specialize in the study of water in just one part of
the hydrologic cycle: hydrometeorologists study water in the atmosphere,
glaciologists study water and ice associated with glaciers, geomorphologists
understand past water events from present landforms, geochemists study
water quality, and hydrogeologists evaluate the effects of geologic conditions
on water in the ground and on the land surface. Engineers who study hydrology
include those in agricultural, civil, environmental, hydraulic, irrigation,
and sanitary engineering.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good hydrologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Good hydrologists are curious about the past and intrigued by the possible
developments of the future. They are trained to observe natural processes
that may unfold over long periods of time, make notes of their observations,
and analyze them critically. Hydrologists often love the outdoors and are
drawn to their profession by a feeling of social responsibility or an environmental
ethic. Many hydrologic studies now include scientists with expertise in
other fields, so a hydrologist must have good communication skills and
be able to work as a team member to solve problems.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a hydrologist
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The work of hydrologists is as varied as the uses of water and may range
from planning multimillion dollar interstate water projects to advising
homeowners about backyard drainage problems and advising engineers on the
construction of wetlands. Scientists and engineers working in hydrology
may be involved in both field investigations and office work. In the field,
they may collect physical data from rivers, streams, and wells; collect
water samples and conduct tests of water quality; direct field crews; and
work with heavy equipment and delicate monitoring devices. Many hydrology
jobs require travel, some local, some abroad. A hydrologist's field sites
may range from suburban yards to remote and rugged terrain accessed by
helicopter. In the office, hydrologists interpret hydrologic data, write
reports, and prepare oral presentations of results. Much of their work
relies on computers for organizing, summarizing and analyzing masses of
data, and for developing predictive models of phenomena such as river flooding,
the consequences of reservoir releases, and the effect of leaking underground
oil storage tanks on nearby ground water supplies.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a hydrologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Students who plan to become hydrologists need training in mathematics,
statistics, geology, physics, computer science, chemistry, and biology.
In addition, some background in other subjects - economics, public finance,
environmental law, government policy - can be useful for communicating
with experts in those fields and to understand the implications of their
work on hydrology. A hydrologist must learn to write clearly and concisely
in order to communicate results to policymakers, regulators, other scientists,
and the general public. Experience in public speaking is also useful to
the hydrologist, who will often make public presentations to those audiences.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Hydrologists work both in research positions and applied areas wherever
the availability, quality, or disposal of water is part of the task. Employers
include a variety of federal agencies such as the Departments of Agriculture,
Commerce, Defense, and Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
State and local governments also hire hydrolologists to help manage the
use and preservation of water resources. Environmental consulting firms
also provide many career opportunities for hydrologists, and university
faculty not only conduct research but also teach new students.
