<P>Biology encompasses a wide variety of subdisciplines such as biochemistry,
microbiology, physiology, botany, toxicology, embryology, ornithology,
mammalogy, and zoology. Biology also encompasses related disciplines in
natural resource management such as ecology, forestry, silviculture, range
management, and wildlife management. A biologist studies the origin, relationship,
development, anatomy, and/or functions of living organisms ranging in
size from microscopic to large.

<P>Physicians, veterinarians, medical researchers, and medical technicians
are all biologists working to understand the biology of the human body
and other organisms. Through human and animal research, they seek to develop
cures for cancer and other diseases, and they investigate inheritance,
immunological functions, microorganisms, physiological functions, and morphology
(the form and structure) of cells and organs. Other biologists are concerned
with understanding the relationships between organisms (plants and animals)
and how to help manage their populations in the wild. Others are concerned
with improving the quality and yield of crops.

The greater western mastiff bat (Eumops perotis) is the largest bat in 
North America. Only a few roosts for this species are known and much about them is still to be determined. Here, Forest Service Biologist Heather Green
is holding a female mastiff bat that will be fixed with a radio transmitter so that its roost can be located.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good biologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>To be a good biologist, an individual should be interested in the life
sciences and should understand mechanisms involved in living organisms.
She does not have to have superior intelligence but needs to have common
sense and be able to use logical reasoning.

<P>There are two aspects of a career in biology: research and management.
Both researchers and managers in the biological sciences need to be enthusiastic
and interested in the work; inquiring; willing to work independently and
in collaboration with others at local, national, and international levels;
and able to communicate their findings, orally and in writing, in clear
and concise language. As in most other scientific disciplines, they must
be motivated and organized since there always seems to be more work than
time in which to do it.

<P>A research biologist needs to be imaginative in order to design appropriate
and relevant experiments. She must be familiar with research techniques
and with laboratory equipment such as electron microscopes and centrifuges;
a knowledge of computers can also be useful in conducting and interpreting
experiments. A manager in the biological sciences needs to be dedicated
and flexible to be able to deal with the various organizations that have
opinions on how lands and animals should be managed.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a biologist
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A biologist's typical workday depends upon her education and specialty.
A research biologist with a Ph.D. degree may conduct independent research
at a research institute, in a medical school, in an undergraduate college
or a university, or in industry. In all these environments, with perhaps
the exception of industry, she may direct graduate students in independent
research and academic studies. Although most biologists do research in
a laboratory setting, some, particularly botanists and zoologists, may
take field trips that involve strenuous physical labor and primitive living
conditions. Time may also be devoted to writing scientific papers or chapters
of books and grants for federal funding to support research, traveling
to and presenting scientific papers at national and international conferences,
reviewing scientific literature, or serving in a management or administrative
position.

General bat surveys using mist
nets over water sources give biologists an idea of what species are in
the area. Radio telemetry can then be used to determine roost locations
and foraging areas. Forest Service District Biologist Melissa Siders is
holding a big free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops macrotus) captured during mist
netting.

<P>A research biologist with a master's or bachelor's degree applies skills
required for laboratory or medical research as a laboratory technician.
Depending on the laboratory, she may have a great deal of freedom to design
her own experiments or, on the other hand, she may be a "pair of hands"
assisting with experiments already designed. With a master's degree, her
responsibility is greater and may include a supervisory position in a clinical
laboratory. She may also be employed in
industry, testing and inspecting food, drugs, and other products, or
selling and/or servicing technical equipment.

<P>A management biologist with a master's or bachelor's degree applies
skills required for field surveys for federal (Forest Service, Bureau of
Land Management, or Park Service), state, and private (e.g., Nature Conservancy
or industrial) land management agencies. Depending on the agency, she may
have a great deal of freedom to determine her own field work, or she may
be a member of a crew assisting in larger management projects. If she has
a master's degree, her responsibility is greater and may include a supervisory
position or a position with the responsibility of making management decisions.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a biologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>You do not need an advanced degree to become a biologist, although your
independence in conducting research increases with an advanced degree.
A master's degree normally takes two to three years of classroom studies
beyond a bachelor's degree. It frequently requires a research project and
a thesis. A Ph.D. degree, which often takes four to seven years beyond
a bachelor's degree, requires classroom studies, work on an independent
research project with a faculty advisor, and preparation of a written thesis.
A Ph.D. degree is necessary if you want a faculty position at a university
or medical school. A master's degree is becoming required more frequently
for year-round positions with management agencies.

<P>In college you should take any biology or biology-related courses offered.
In addition, mathematics, chemistry, and physics courses are absolutely
essential. All of these help build the background you need to think logically
in devising and analyzing a research or management problem. Take a broad
range of courses in your field and in related fields. A broad background
provides you with knowledge essential to your own field of study and for
collaborative work. You will specialize in a specific area if you decide
to obtain an advanced degree such as a Ph.D.

<P>It is highly recommended that you obtain experience during summer breaks
from college in various temporary jobs in biology. This will not only make
you more competitive once you finish your degree, but it will also allow
you to explore various aspects of biology to determine your interests and
skills.

Biologists can conduct surveys
in remote and interesting places. This is a Forest Service Biological Technician
(Laura Williams) entering a cave to determine what wildlife use was occurring
in the cave to assist in the evaluation of whether it is being impacted
by human uses.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Biologists are employed in universities, medical schools, hospitals,
industry, and various government agencies. About one-third of all biologists
are involved primarily in research and development; one-fifth are primarily
involved in teaching. Some work as managers for federal, state, or local
government agencies. Some work as consultants to business firms or to federal,
state, or local government agencies. Employment in biology will increase
faster than the average for all occupations in the next decade because
of the continuing interest in medical research and the increased concern
about preserving the environment. Opportunities are particularly good for
biologists with advanced degrees; those with lesser degrees may face competition
for the available jobs.
