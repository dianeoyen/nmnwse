<P>Astronomers (as well as astrophysicists and space scientists) study
objects and environments beyond the surface and atmosphere of Earth. What
they learn often has implications for understanding how the Earth came
to be as it is. They may use telescopes, ground-based detectors, or satellites
to gather data about the conditions of objects in space, or of space itself,
from as far away as the most distant quasar (billions of light years away)
to as nearby as the space in Earth's orbit (200 miles up). They apply the
laws of nature, often assisted by numerical "models", or simulations programmed
into a computer, to make sense of this data. They attempt to answer such
questions as, "What is the age of the universe, and will it continue to
expand forever? How was the distribution of elements that we find on Earth
(including the atoms in our own bodies) produced? How did our solar system
form? Do solar systems capable of supporting life exist around other stars?
What is going on inside the stars and at the violent centers of galaxies?
Can we predict when a star will explode as a supernova? Can we predict
when the next asteroid or comet will pass near the Earth or even impact
the Earth?"

<P>A strong curiosity about nature is a prime characteristic of an astronomer,
along with the ability to imagine and visualize conditions much different
than those of everyday experience. The universe presents us with examples
of phenomena occurring at the extremes (both high and low) of pressure,
temperature, density, and gravity that we cannot reproduce (at least not
easily!) in laboratories on Earth. Since technology is progressing so rapidly,
it is important for you to be versatile. You must be willing to learn quickly
and explore new ways of doing your work. Since your discoveries are much
more useful to others when they are communicated, good writing and speaking
skills are essential. It also helps immensely to be patient and persistent
and to be organized enough to work on several projects at once, as many
projects will take years to complete. You should also enjoy working with
others; many projects are done in teams.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as an astronomer
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>One of the best aspects of being an astronomer is the variety of tasks
that astronomers do each day. Most astronomers have quite a bit of freedom
in planning their own research projects and approaches.

<P>The tasks could be preparing lessons and teaching classes, supervising
students, building equipment, developing ideas or analyzing data on paper
or on a computer, writing journal articles, discussing ideas and giving
seminars at your institution or at national and international conferences,
serving on committees in your department or for professional associations,
reading journal articles, and evaluating the research of others before
it is published. Electronic mail has become the medium of choice to discuss
your research and plan projects or conferences with colleagues from around
the globe. Most major journals, reports, and astronomical data are now
accessible from your desktop computer using the Internet.

<P>Note that very few astronomers spend large amounts of time looking through
a telescope. Most operate telescopes from a control room (as in the photo)
or even from their computer at home via the Internet. Typical astronomers
only spend one or two weeks each year observing, and the rest of their
research time analyzing their data.

<P>The rewards of being an astronomer are a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment,
and even jubilation at finding the missing evidence to support a theory,
or putting pieces of data together to give you a new insight into the nature
of the universe. The work environment can be wonderful - astronomy is still
a relatively small field, and those who work in your area of specialization
form an even smaller community. It is fun to travel to remote observing
sites and to conferences and to interact with astronomers from around the
world.

In high school take as much math and science as you can, including physics,
chemistry, pre-calculus, and computer science. Do not neglect English or
public speaking opportunities, such as speech or debate, because you will
spend much of your time writing grant proposals and journal articles and
giving talks at seminars and conferences about your latest results.

<P>In college, you can major in physics, mathematics, computer science,
chemistry, or earth science. If you plan to be an observational astronomer
or build satellites, take electronics or electrical engineering as well
as drafting classes. Be sure to take some science courses outside your
major. Interpretation of astrophysical phenomena requires an extensive
knowledge of many fields of science, particularly physics. Do not neglect
courses in languages and the humanities; these will enhance your communication
skills and versatility.

<P>Most jobs in astronomy require a master's or Ph.D. degree. A master's
degree takes a year or two beyond college and may lead to a job in a planetarium,
teaching at a community college, as a support person or data analyst at
an observatory or research institute, or perhaps as a science writer for
a newspaper or magazine. A Ph.D. requires a thesis on independent research
and is almost always required to become a professor at a college or university.
Most professors are expected to carry out research programs and supervise
students in addition to teaching. Many astronomers work at observatories
(such as the Kitt Peak National Observatory), research institutes (such
as the Space Telescope Science Institute), or laboratories (such as the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory).

<P>While the demand for astronomers has been decreasing in recent years,
there are signs that the trend is leveling out and perhaps reversing. The
field of astronomy has become even more exciting with the possibilities
of new types of data from more sensitive detectors; with detailed images
from the Hubble Space Telescope and other satellites; and with recent missions
to the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The capability to perform increasingly
complex and realistic numerical simulations and process huge volumes of
data has also increased dramatically with the advent of new generations
of supercomputers and considerable computing power available on desktop
computers. New discoveries are being made every day, as can often be seen
from newspaper headlines or from picking up a copy of Sky and Telescope
or Astronomy magazine. Recent observations are presenting new mysteries
faster than they are supplying answers - we have much more work to do!
