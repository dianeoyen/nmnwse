<P>
Most people do not even know what an engineer does!?!?  
And it is difficult to sum up the field of engineering in just a few words.  In a broad sense,
engineering is the application of math and science to create something of value.  
An engineer is not the same as a scientist.  While both have a background in math and science,
an engineer applies these basic principles to practical problems.  A scientist is not as 
application oriented, and is dedicated to the understanding of basic principles.
Engineers are also very creative people.  They create new things and make old things better.
People in the arts are creative people also; but their creativity deals with thoughts or emotions.  
Engineering creativity deals with things.  Things?  A great example of this is the design of roller
coasters!  This incorporates a wide range of engineering specialties to create a combination
of fun and safety.  Some of these specialties might include electronic controls, computer aided 
design (CAD), aerodynamics, mechanical systems, incorporation of modern materials, and structural innovations.
<P>
Some of the most popular disciplines of engineering are also some of the oldest.  The core list
includes: civil, chemical, electrical, and mechanical.  There are a variety of specialties within any
single discipline, and there is also a lot of overlap between the different disciplines.
Most engineers specialize in an area based on their individual interests. 
The field of <B>civil engineering</B>  [asce.org] is concerned with development and improvement. It involves the conception,
 planning, design, construction, and operation of facilities essential to modern life. This may range from transit systems to 
offshore structures to space satellites. Civil engineers are problem solvers, meeting the challenges of pollution, traffic 
congestion, drinking water and energy needs, urban redevelopment, and community planning. 

<B>Chemical engineers</B> [aiche.org] work in the areas of manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, food
processing, polymers, and biotechnology.  They strive to make the world better by looking for hardier
strains of wheat, rice, and corn that will survive drought, insects, and disease.  A chemical 
engineer might design high strength plastic composites, or join the war against cancer and other deadly
diseases.

<B>Electrical engineers</B> [ieee.org] get to design things like cell phones, computers, integrated circuits, stereo systems, and space vehicles. 
An electrical engineer may work on ways to improve the transmission of messages by laser, or ways to automatically detect cancer cells.
They have even worked with medical doctors to invent things like pacemakers, sonograms, and x-ray machines. 


<B>Mechanical engineers</B> [asme.org] play a key role in the invention and improvements
of the automobile, airplane, air conditioning, space exploration, power generation, computer aided design, and bioengineering.
A mechanical engineer works with areas such as heat transfer, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics and numerical modeling, and simulations.

<B>Other specialties</B> include, but are not limited to, aerospace, environmental, safety, fire protection, 
agricultural, manufacturing, computer, materials, ceramic, nuclear, geological, industrial, textile, 
petroleum, geothermal, naval, optical, robotics, transportation, metallurgy, and mining engineering. 

<P>An engineering education will open many doors to technical and creative challenges. 
Because engineers typically provide services that relate directly to 
producing a product or service that can be sold, they are usually in high demand 
in the job market. Engineers can normally find employment directly in the field 
for which they have studied.

<P><B><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT size=+1>What makes a good 
engineer?</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P>Potential engineers usually demonstrate a number of problem solving traits.
They tend to enjoy science and mathematics (try
not to equate enjoyment of a subject matter to the individual teacher or grade).
Engineers must keep up-to-date with the latest techniques and information.  
Another important trait is the ability to present results, both in writing and orally.
Additional qualities include being logical, wanting to make things work better, and enjoying working
in the laboratory and working in groups. A commitment to lifelong learning is a necessity to be 
a successful engineer.  If you have any or all of these characteristics,
then engineering may be the field for you!

<P><B><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT size=+1>What is life as an 
engineer like?</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P>Most engineers work weekdays, Monday through Friday. Typically they work from eight to ten hours 
per day. The type of work environment for an engineer  depends upon the specialty that she selects. 
Most engineers work in offices; others may work outdoors part of the time. 
Engineers may travel, depending mainly upon the company they work for and the 
work they are performing for them. Many opportunities exist for engineers who wish to work in foreign 
countries. Engineers have a great deal of responsibility in their jobs. Some make a transition to 
management later in their careers. When additional learning is necessary, employers usually subsidize or 
reimburse engineering education and training expenses. 

<P>Engineers generally earn a nice salary. An engineer will typically make more than 
most salaried professionals,  but not as much as some of other professionals such 
as doctors or lawyers.  An entrepreneurial engineer can go into private practice, or 
create her own company, and do quite well.

<P><B><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT size=+1>How do I become an 
engineer?</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P>Engineering is a difficult major.  It requires a considerable amount of time and
energy, but the rewards are well worth it!  You can begin your engineering career right now!! Take as
many math and science courses as you can and gain experience with computers.  However, do not
neglect your english classes, as engineers are expected to be able to write technical papers
about their work and present their work to other engineers, and even their customer.  Additionally,
get involved in extracurricular activities - you do not have to be a nerd to be an engineer!  A
well-rounded engineer is a highly desired commodity.
<P>
A bachelor's degree in engineering is necessary (for most jobs).  A bachelor's degree in engineering is available
through a four- or five-year accredited college or university program.  An 
engineering student will take classes in two categories, humanities and engineering.  The humanities will 
probably have an equal ratio of men to women.  The engineering (including math and science) classes
will have more men than women.
<P>
After obtaining a bachelor's degree, you can either find a job, or attend graduate
school and obtain a master's degree (1 1/2 years to 2 1/2 years) or a Ph.D. (approximately 5 years).
These are referred to as advanced degrees. They may earn a promotion or simply
help keep up with new technologies.  A Ph.D. is needed for most teaching and
research positions.  Because of the demand for engineers, many companies offer
funding and financial assistance to employees seeking additional education.

<P>It is possible to combine an undergraduate engineering degree with advanced degrees in 
other fields. Many executives began their careers as engineers and later earned 
a master's degree in business administration (MBA). Other engineers obtain law 
degrees and specialize in areas of law relating to technology and patents.  Obtaining a chemical
engineering degree has historically been a great way to get into medical school.

<P>College engineering programs for the bachelor's degree are solidly founded in 
mathematics and science. In a typical four-year curriculum, the first two years 
are spent studying basic sciences - math, chemistry, physics, introductory 
engineering, and the humanities. The last two years are spent studying one or 
more of the engineering specialties. Often students find that it takes five 
years to complete their bachelor's degree. Many colleges and universities offer 
five- or six-year cooperative education programs that provide experience and 
allow the student to earn a substantial part of her educational expenses. In 
such a program, a semester of full-time academic study alternates with a 
semester of full-time engineering-related work (and pay!). 

<P><B><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT size=+1>What/where are the 
jobs?</FONT></FONT></B> 
<P>Engineers are in demand in the job market, and the outlook for jobs in the 
future is good. Engineers work wherever problems need to be solved, 
whether at a construction site, at a desk in an office, or in a research 
laboratory. Nearly half of all engineering jobs are in manufacturing industries, 
including microelectronics. Nonmanufacturing jobs are in research and testing services, 
construction, and utilities. Other engineers work for government, mainly the federal government in 
the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Agriculture, Interior, and Energy 
and in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Some engineers 
are self-employed consultants, and others are entrepreneurs who start their own 
companies. Engineers work in large and small cities and in rural areas, and 
employment can be found in every state.
