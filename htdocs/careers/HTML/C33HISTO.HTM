<P> A histologist is a laboratory professional who has received specialized training in preparing human, animal, plant or other samples for examination and diagnosis by a pathologist. The histologist is concerned with cellular structure, chemical composition and function of normal and abnormal tissues.  The specimen is processed with specialized equipment that allows the histologist to cut very thin sections (normally 4/10,000 of an inch), then treating with dyes and chemicals yielding a tissue section on a glass slide that exhibits tissue structure. The slide is then examined by a pathologist to evaluate normal or abnormal conditions.

<P>
Histologists have certain common characteristics: they are problem-solvers, like challenges, embrace responsibility, and appreciate the need for accuracy and reliability in their profession.  Histologists work well under pressure and expect quality and commitment from themselves.  They are deeply committed to their profession, being truly fascinated by all that science has to offer.

Because the work of histology requires the preparation of samples as quickly as
possible to allow the pathologist to communicate a diagnosis to the primary
care provider, work hours often begin in the very early mornings.
In larger hospitals and reference
laboratories, the lab runs shifts that oftentimes provide 24/7 coverage, thus
offering a variety of hours available to the histologist.
The histologist must function as part
of a team, every member of which is dedicated to producing quality work in a
fast-paced environment. There is a certain amount of pressure to meet deadlines
- your work may provide the critical piece of evidence needed to diagnose
the patient, solve the crime or confirm the effectiveness of a new
pharmaceutical.


<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a 
histologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>
To prepare for a career as a histologist, a student should have a solid foundation
in high school sciences (biology, chemistry, math, and computer science).
Clinical education is required in a
histology training program accredited by the National Accrediting Agency for
Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS) or an associate degree from a community
college and training at a hospital.
To ensure that the histologist is competent and able to perform high
quality testing, the Board of Registry of the American Society for Clinical
Pathology (ASCP) gives a national certification exam.
Students take the exam after meeting their academic and
clinical laboratory education requirements.
Those who pass the exam may use the initials "HT (ASCP)"
after their name to make known their proficiency in the field.
It is highly likely that a histologist
can begin work immediately upon completion of training.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>
With current television series dealing with forensic pathology and crime
scene investigation, attention has become focused on the importance of the
laboratory professions in general and histology in specific.
It is the smallest detail and the technician's knowledge and experience
that are critical to diagnosis or solution.
Without the histologist who has the expertise to provide this vital link, the
pathologist cannot diagnose the condition for the surgeon, who in turn
communicates with the patient's primary care provider to plan for resolution
or care. Histologists have an unlimited choice of practice settings.
Hospitals, reference laboratories, clinics, public health facilities and industry
currently have positions open.
Other opportunities include pharmaceutical and industrial research, anatomic and
clinical pathology, forensic pathology, and marine biology.
At this writing, there are more than 250 positions available across the country
and the demand for histologists will only grow.
Positions currently available can be found at the NSH website and many others,
including <a href="http://www.histologyjobs.com">http://www.histologyjobs.com</a>.
