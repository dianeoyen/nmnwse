<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a toxicologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A toxicologist studies the adverse effects of chemical agents on biological
systems. The toxicologist performs studies to determine how easily a chemical
enters an organism, how it behaves inside the organism, how rapidly it
is removed from the organism, what cells are affected by the chemicals,
and what cell functions are impaired.

<P>The professional activities of toxicologists fall into three main categories:
descriptive, mechanistic, and regulatory. The descriptive toxicologist
is concerned directly with toxicity testing. In this field she designs
the appropriate toxicity tests in experimental animals or cell cultures
to yield information that can be used to evaluate the risk posed to humans
and the environment by exposure to specific chemicals. The mechanistic
toxicologist is concerned with determining the mechanisms by which chemicals
exert their toxic effects on living organisms. The regulatory toxicologist
has the responsibility of deciding (on the basis of data provided by the
descriptive toxicologist) if a drug or other chemical poses a sufficiently
low risk to people when marketed for a stated purpose.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good toxicologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Good toxicologists are curious about the way chemicals and environmental
factors interact with the body. They must be interested not only in the
final outcome of that interaction but what goes on at the molecular level
(i.e., how individual chemicals interact with cells and cellular functions).
A toxicologist must be capable of critical thinking and have good observation
skills. She must be a good communicator and have a strong background in
biology, chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, and anatomy. Writing skills
are essential for getting project funds and for publishing results. Good
oral presentation skills are important for communicating results and providing
data to regulatory boards.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a toxicologist
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Toxicologists address their hypotheses by observing the effects of model
compounds in whole animals and cellular extracts. Therefore, they must
be willing to work with animals in a humane and appropriate manner to develop
information that is necessary to translate to human applications. Because
chemical interactions involve various biological systems, toxicologists
must be able to work with researchers in other fields outside of toxicology
to get necessary data to understand important mechanisms. In addition,
researchers in applied toxicology must have a broad understanding of the
field in order to provide information to forensic, clinical, or regulatory
agencies.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a toxicologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Toxicology is a broad field that can accommodate many interests. To
become a toxicologist you should take as much math and science in high
school as possible. Be sure to study biology, chemistry, physics, and math
such as trigonometry, algebra, and calculus. In addition to general studies,
your undergraduate education should include environmental studies, biological
sciences, biochemistry, chemistry, physics, calculus, and statistics. Courses
in areas of specialization can be taken in graduate school to obtain M.S.
and Ph.D. degrees in toxicology.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Toxicologists can work in research positions at universities and private
industry and applied areas primarily in private industry and government.
Research in toxicology can include studies of the toxicity of chemicals
on the various systems of the body including nervous system, endocrine
system, digestive system, respiratory system, immune system, and cardiovascular
system. Such research can assess the effects of toxicity on such target
organs as the kidneys, lungs, liver, heart, eyes, etc.

<P>Applied toxicology includes studies in three specialized areas: forensic,
clinical, and environmental. Forensic toxicology is a hybrid of analytical
chemistry and fundamental toxicological principles. It is concerned primarily
with the establishment of cause-of-death in postmortem investigations.
Clinical toxicology is concerned with the effects of drugs on disease or
with abuse. The clinical toxicologist provides important information to
emergency room physicians and nurses. Environmental toxicologists usually
study the effects of pollutants on wildlife and subsequently on the ecosystem,
including the effects of environmental pollutants on humans.
