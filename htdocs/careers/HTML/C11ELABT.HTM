<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a lab technician?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A lab technician is someone who has learned the practical details and
special techniques that are required in a modern scientific laboratory.
Lab technicians can be found in such diverse fields as electronics, mechanics,
biology, chemistry, and metallurgy. Computer technicians usually go to
the computers rather than bringing them to a lab to work on.

<P>
Lab technicians
generally work with scientists and engineers, running experiments, conducting
research projects that can result in new ideas and expand our scientific
knowledge, or running routine diagnostic samples. Thus, lab technicians
contribute to the scientific teamwork responsible for the many new developments,
products, and breakthroughs that are seen from day to day and taken for
granted by all.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good lab
technician?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>To be a good lab technician certain qualities are needed. You should
be able to work well with others. Many projects are worked on jointly by
a group consisting of a project leader, often an engineer, and other lab
technicians. You should be willing and able to voice your opinion and to
volunteer your ideas to help the group meet its ultimate goal. You must
also have the initiative to work on a project that might be assigned only
to you. Determination and patience are often needed to meet schedules and
solve problems that present obstacles. You should also have the patience
to run the same or similar tests over and over again for routine samples.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a lab
technician like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>What you do on the job depends greatly on your field of specialty. For
example, if you are an electronics technician, you might take a circuit
design, gather all the necessary components or parts, build the circuit,
test it, and troubleshoot the circuit if it is not working. After the circuit
works, you would do the necessary checkouts of the circuit - electrical
continuity, environmental tests such as temperature cycling and air gun
shock tests, and any required calibrations. A typical project for a mechanical
technician might be to take a design for a scientific apparatus, prepare
the necessary mechanical drawings, set up the apparatus, test to make sure
it performs the required function, and make any needed modifications.

<P>Research on a project can sometimes be long and tedious. But after the
project is complete and you have achieved your goal, the feeling of satisfaction
you have is very rewarding.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a lab
technician?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Lab technicians in any field need at least a two-year associate degree
and, increasingly, a bachelor's degree. Associate degrees are offered at
many institutions such as junior colleges, community colleges, many four-year
colleges, and private technical schools. To become a scientist or engineer,
you almost always need a more advanced degree.

<P>Northern New Mexico Community College offers a program sponsored by
Intel to train wafer fabrication technicians. UNM-Los Alamos offers several
programs to train chemical technicians, radiation control technicians,
and others. The Technical Vocational Institute in Albuquerque has similar
courses, as well as several to train hospital technicians, electronics
technicians, and others.

<P>Take as much mathematics as possible in both high school and in your
further training. In order to solve many technical problems, advanced mathematics
can be necessary. Computer science is also needed; the computer is very
commonplace in scientific laboratories today as a tool in analyzing data,
solving problems, or plotting graphs. Take science courses. These courses
contain many of the basic theories you will need later to understand the
research projects you are working on.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The demand for lab technicians is always increasing. Employment can
be found in hospitals, food packing companies, and sanitation plants, as
well as in private and government laboratories. The computer industry has
created whole new categories of technicians, such as wafer fabrication technicians,
who are hired by chip manufacturing plants.
