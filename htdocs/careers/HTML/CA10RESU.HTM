<P>Okay, now that you've assessed your talents and know how you wish to
display them in the world of work, it's time to go get a job! First, you
need a resume targeting the job you're going for. Now, we know you have
many talents but for this resume, we want to highlight your skills and
abilities that pertain to this particular job.

<P>A resume is a summary of who you are and how you can do the job at hand
in two pages or less. Since it is a reflection of you and the quality of
work you do, typos, misspellings, poor grammar, and lying (even a small
lie) are <B>NOT</B> acceptable.

<P>There are basically three types of resumes: chronological, functional,
and a combination of the two. Chronological resumes list the paid and unpaid
experience you've acquired in reverse chronological order (i.e., most recent
experience first). Functional resumes allow you to highlight your skills
or areas of effectiveness. A combination resume does both. Samples of chronological
and combination resumes follow.

<P>Typical categories in a resume include contact information, objective,
experience, work history, and education. Additional categories are summary
of qualifications, military experience, community involvement, professional
affiliations/licenses/certifications, special skills, awards and recognitions,
interests and activities, and a personal statement. No resume should indicate
salary history or expectations, a photo (unless it is essential for the
job), race, religion, political affiliation or sexual orientation, nor
any negative information (e.g., terminated from a job, mental/physical
health problems). Choose the categories that make the most sense for you
and allow you to highlight your skills most effectively.

<P>Write your accomplishments in the "verb noun why result" format for
greatest effectiveness. For example, "I wrote a series of training manuals
that shortened training time and increased productivity by twenty percent."

<P>How do you know if your resume is effective? Give it to ten people.
Ask each to spend thirty seconds looking it over. Then ask them to tell
you what kind of job you're applying for and whether they think you could
do the job. If their answers to the first question are in line with your
target job, and they give an unequivocal "Yes!" to the second question,
you've got an effective resume!

<P>Some good references on resume writing, interviews, and career planning
are:
