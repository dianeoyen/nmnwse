<P>Health physics is devoted to protecting people and the environment
from radiation hazards, while making it possible to enjoy the benefits
of the peaceful use of the atom. Health physics is diverse and one of the
most interesting and rewarding fields of scientific endeavor. Many industries,
medical facilities, national laboratories, and research laboratories demand
professionals who understand radiation hazards and their prevention and
control.

<P>For decades, ionizing radiation has been used in beneficial ways, such
as in medicine, treating cancer, irradiating food and medical wastes to
destroy bacteria, and generating electrical power. But when used unsafely,
ionizing radiation can harm living organisms. Care must be taken with nuclear
reactors, high-energy particle accelerators, x-ray machines, and radionuclides
used in biomedical research and therapy. Health physicists help minimize
the potential for unnecessary irradiation of individuals or environmental
contamination. Health physicists work in a variety of disciplines, including
medicine, research, industry, education, environmental protection, and
enforcement of government regulations. Although usually concentrating in
one of these areas, a health physicist typically performs duties in several
areas.

<!--
Environmental Health Specialist Jamie A. Keeley, of EG&G Florida Inc., uses an ion chamber dose rate meter to measure radiation levels in one of three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) that will provide electrical power to the Cassini spacecraft on its mission to explore the Saturnian system. The three RTGs and one spare are being tested and monitored in the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator Storage Building in the KSC's Industrial Area. The RTGs use heat from the natural decay of plutonium to generate electric power. RTGs enable spacecraft to operate far from the Sun where solar power systems are not feasible. The RTGs on Cassini are of the same design as those flying on the already deployed Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft. The Cassini mission is targeted for an Oct. 6 launch aboard a Titan IVB/Centaur expendable launch vehicle.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good health
physicist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A good health physicist needs to be able to draw from a wide variety
of disciplines including physics, biology, biophysics, engineering (nuclear,
civil, mechanical, or electrical), physiology, genetics, ecology, environmental
sciences, toxicology, meteorology, and industrial hygiene. These disciplines
must be integrated in an analytical fashion to solve specific problems.
Although the health physicist may specialize, a professional health physicist
typically performs duties in several areas. The wide spectrum of knowledge
required of the health physicist makes this profession both challenging
and rewarding.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a health
physicist like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>One of the advantages of health physics is that one may specialize in
one or more of the following fields:

<P><B>Health physics research:</B> If involved in research, a health physicist
may investigate the principles by which radiation interacts with matter
and living systems. Health physicists also study environmental radioactivity
and the effects of radiation on biological systems on earth and in space.
This research is used in many ways, ranging from designing radiation detection
instrumentation to establishing radiation protection standards.

<P><B>Medical health physics:</B> Those interested in medicine may choose
to specialize in medical health physics. They work wherever radiation sources
are used to diagnose and treat human diseases. Hospitals, clinics, and
major medical centers use radiation sources, including x-ray machines,
particle accelerators, and many types of radioactive materials. Medical
health physicists are needed to ensure proper and safe working conditions
for both patients and medical staff. Health physicists may assist physicians
in setting up shielding for x-ray rooms, ensuring that machines are properly
calibrated, assisting with treatment planning for radiation therapy, or
ensuring radiation protection for diagnostic nuclear medicine departments.
The medical health physicist may also teach courses in radiation physics
and biology, and review research projects involving radiation work. Through
her personal supervision of radiation installations in hospitals and clinics,
the health physicist seeks to obtain the maximum benefits of nuclear medicine
with minimum risks of radiation exposure.

<P><B>Environmental health physics:</B> The environmental health physicist
is the professional most closely associated with protecting the public
and environment from unnecessary exposure to manmade and technologically
enhanced natural radioactivity. One important task is the environmental
surveillance for radioactivity, which involves many types of instrumentation
and field sampling technologies. Another typical area of responsibility
is using computer models to assess the environmental impact of radionuclides
released to the environment.

<P><B>Industrial or applied health physics:</B> These health physicists
advise managers regarding methods and equipment for radiation work. She
also assists engineers and scientists in designing facilities and new radiation
control programs.

<P><B>Educational health physics:</B> Those working in education develop
and conduct training programs for future health physicists. They also train
radiation workers and the general public. These individuals instruct workers
and other health physicists regarding the risk associated with radiation
sources and methods used to reduce risk. One goal is to help individuals
understand the relative risk of radiation exposure. In most cases, the
risk is no greater than that found from other hazards in industries. Health
physicists in education may be found in college or university classrooms
and laboratories, or at off-campus training sites where they supervise
student instruction. Sometimes educators conduct their own health physics
research projects and publish their findings.

<P><B>Regulatory enforcement health physics:</B> Those who work in regulatory
enforcement must have knowledge and experience concerning all types of
radiation hazards in order to establish guidelines for adequate radiation
control. These guidelines help society receive the greatest benefits from
radiation sources at the lowest possible risk.

<P><B>Power reactor health physics:</B> A power reactor health physicist
is responsible for all phases of radiation protection at a reactor site.
Responsibilities may include selecting, purchasing, and maintaining radiation
protection, laboratory, and detection equipment. Nuclear power plant workers
require extensive training, while plant process systems require detailed
study. The power reactor health physicist must be ready to respond quickly
and with expertise in the unlikely event of a radiation accident. Health
physicists make assessments of the potential environmental impact and ensure
that the facility complies with federal regulations. Procedures must be
prepared and updated, safety standards and emergency plans must be written,
and preparedness drills conducted. It is common for a power reactor health
physicist to supervise as many as 70-80 technicians and professionals,
such as chemists and radiochemists. The daily work of a power reactor health
physicist may involve reviewing radiological monitoring data for as many
as 2000 employees. Area radiological surveys, radiation records, and internal
and external measurements of radioactivity must be reviewed. In addition,
survey and laboratory results are analyzed to ensure the reactor is operating
within prescribed limits. The power reactor health physicist's career is
multifaceted, satisfying, and rewarding.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a health
physicist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Because health physicists have responsible technical positions in several
disciplines, you will need a broad background of education and experience.
A bachelor's degree with basic education in the physical sciences is necessary,
but training is also required in other areas, such as biology and math.
In addition, most health physicists have a master's degree in health physics.
A few go on to receive a Ph.D. in health physics. Academic programs in
health physics, leading to baccalaureate and advanced degrees, are now
offered in several American universities. These comprehensive programs
will allow you to specialize in areas such as medical physics, biophysics,
nuclear engineering, and radiation biology.

<P><B>Health physics technician:</B> Opportunities also exist in the field
for health physics technicians. The educational requirements are less than
that for a health physicist; two-year associate's degrees in this specialty
are offered by several schools. Academic training alone will not make a
health physicist. Practical experience in applying radiation protection
principles is essential. To provide hands-on, real-life experience, cooperative
programs are offered at many universities in collaboration with national
laboratories and utilities.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Health physicists are in demand in the job market, and the outlook for
jobs in the future is good. They work in research, industry, education,
national laboratories, and government at most every level. Some health
physicists are self-employed consultants, and others are entrepreneurs
who start their own companies. Employment can be found in every state.
