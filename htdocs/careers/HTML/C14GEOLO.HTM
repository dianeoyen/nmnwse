<P>A geologist is a scientist that studies the earth - its origin, history,
and structure. The field of geology is very diverse, as diverse as the
earth itself. The world we live on is a spectacular natural laboratory
just waiting to be explored, its secrets discovered, and its processes
understood. Geologists use their observations to form theories about how
the earth works, how it is structured, and of what materials it is composed.
Studying rocks and their minerals can tell us much about the history of
the earth. Geologists collect information by drilling holes and by collecting
rock and soil samples from the surface. They then examine these samples
in great detail and try to recreate the events that lead to the rocks being
formed and deposited.

<P>There are many branches of geology and thus many types of geologists.
There are mineralogists and petrologists who study minerals and rocks.
There are geophysicists and geochemists who study the physical and chemical
aspects of the earth and its rocks. There are seismologists and volcanologists
who study and help predict earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. There are
economic, exploration, mining, and petroleum geologists who help to find
and develop natural resources such as precious metals and oil. There are
hydrologists who study water flow and water conservation. There are geological
engineers who advise construction engineers on the stability of dams, buildings,
and highways. There are also paleontologists who study fossils, environmental
geologists who work to understand and protect the environment, and even
astrogeologists who study planets and moons. So you see that the sky is
the limit when studying geology!

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good geologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>To be a good geologist you must have good observation skills. This means
being able to observe something and describe it in detail, in writing and
verbally, so that you or others can use the information to draw conclusions.
Being a good geologist also requires having the ability to take the information
that you or someone else has collected and figure out the meaning of that
information. You must be an "interpreter" of what the rocks tell you. It
is sort of like being a private investigator: you must seek out clues and
use the clues to solve some mystery.

<P>To be a good geologist, you must also love science in general. The field
of geology is a combination of many sciences: earth science, physics, chemistry,
biology, mathematics, and engineering. A basic understanding of all of
these sciences is a must for a successful geologist. However, geologists
also work with professionals in these fields so that when true expertise
is needed, it is available.

<P>Most of all a good geologist must love what she does. The satisfaction
of working in her chosen area will give her the determination and motivation
to be creative in her methods and thorough in her investigations. She should
enjoy working independently and as part of a team. She should love the
outdoors but not be intimidated by computers and other laboratory machinery.
She should be in the field of geology for the love of it, not for the money.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a geologist
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Depending on the specific branch of geology, a geologist may spend most
of her time in the field or in the office. Most positions involve a balance
of both. Life as a geologist can mean very long hours in the field collecting
data. Many times deadlines on reports also require more than an eight-hour
day. Geologists are professional scientists so they must often design their
own study programs. This takes organization and foresight in planning.
The program of study often involves collaboration with professionals from
other fields. Geologists spend much of their time working with others but
must also be able to work independently and trust their own knowledge.

<P>Some branches of geology, such as exploration, mining and petroleum
geology, volcanology, and environmental geology require that you travel
and work on location. This may mean being away from home for months at
a time or moving frequently. Keep in mind this possible demand for relocation
when you are considering your career choice. Other positions, such as research
or teaching positions or government or consulting jobs, may provide long-term
stability in one location and require little or no travel. Most careers
in geology do require some field work, even if it is just to stay in touch
with the earth and to keep field skills sharp.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a geologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>If you like rocks and minerals and you like the outdoors, you are well
on your way to becoming a geologist already. To get a head start on college,
you should try to take as many math and science courses as possible while
in junior high and high school. You can also start learning about the rocks
and minerals that you collect. Collecting rocks and minerals is a fun way
to learn about geology.

<P>Careers in geology require a bachelor's degree as a minimum (that's
at least four years of college). Because there are so many specific fields
of geology, however, it is very worthwhile to receive further education
and get a master's degree or Ph.D. (that's anywhere from six to ten years
of college but worth it!). During undergraduate education the required
classes give you just the basics in all of the fields of geology. You do
not really get into any specific subject in great detail unless you go
to graduate school.

<P>In order to specialize in one of the specific fields of geology, you
should continue your education after your bachelor's degree and pursue
a master's degree. There you can decide what interests you most and study
it in great detail, doing your own research and coming up with your own
discoveries! This is a time of great learning. Obtaining a master's degree
or Ph.D. in your area will help guarantee that you will find a professional
position in your geological field of choice. A bachelor's degree is not
worthless though. It can be more difficult to get into your favorite field,
but it is not unusual. Many geologists with bachelor's degrees are top-notch
in their fields. It takes a little more perseverance and study, but what
can be learned in further schooling can often be learned on the job as
well.

<P>During your college education you will have a chance to learn about
all of the basic sciences - math, chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering.
Beginning classes of geology teach about the earth's processes, history,
and place in the solar system. Next you will learn about the many different
types of rocks and minerals and how geologists classify them. You will
also learn about the structure of the earth and its physics and chemistry.
Many of the classes have field exercises where you get a chance to get
out of the classroom and do some hands-on field mapping and rock identification.
Most universities also require a six-week field-camp course where you learn
in detail the field methods required to be a geologist.

<P>One good way to help you learn about what geologists do first-hand,
and to help you gain valuable experience, is to work with geologists in
a summer internship program during your undergraduate years. Many mining
and petroleum companies offer summer student employment. Check with your
advisor and ask around in your geology department to learn about opportunities
such as these. Career-related experience during college is the best thing
you can have to increase your chances of finding a job when you graduate.
You gain experience, exposure, and valuable contacts.

<P>One of the most exciting and fun things about a career in geology is
being able to travel and visit beautiful and exotic areas of the world.
Geologists work on every continent and in every ocean. There are many possible
types of careers and thus many types of job settings, from the research
laboratory to the classroom, to the field.

<P>Geologists work for many types of employers such as government agencies
like the U.S. Geological Survey, mining and mineral exploration companies,
petroleum companies, construction firms, colleges and universities, and
research institutions. Some geologists are self-employed as private consultants.
Geology provides a wide variety of opportunities in many locations; that's
what makes it so inviting!
