and Sexual Prejudice</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>A woman who chooses a nontraditional career may face a largely different
set of challenges and problems than those encountered by one who holds
a job in a traditionally female field. If you are contemplating a male-dominated
profession, you should realize that sexual stereotyping and sexual prejudice
may exist. If you are aware of these problems, you will be better able
to deal with them effectively. Failure to do so can mean failure in your
career and/or personal unhappiness and maladjustment.

<P>Sexual stereotyping and prejudice can cause women to be treated unequally
by others, either because of hostility towards women or, less wittingly,
because popular attitudes about women make it seem proper to treat them
differently than men. Also, social conditioning incorporated into a woman's
personality through her upbringing and environment can affect the way she
acts and thinks about herself.

<P>Overt sexual prejudice is generally easier to recognize. A female scientist
or a businesswoman may find that she is not taken seriously, that her opinions
are not as highly valued, and that her career is not considered important
by those around her. She may find that some co-workers do not seek her
advice and opinion. The more important the solution to a problem, the less
she may be sought to provide it. Instead, she may find herself being given
"busy work" that a male would not do because it is too dull. In fields
such as science, where good ideas and an individual's reputation among
her peers are often the main determining factors in being rated by an employer,
the effects of this type of prejudice can be overwhelming.

<P>Sexual prejudice can take more subtle but just as devastating forms.
A new young male colleague is more readily incorporated into the "old boy"
network. Older male co-workers may be happy to include him in their Friday
lunch group, an impromptu basketball game, or other social endeavors, but
may feel awkward about including his female counterpart. This slight, although
not deliberate, can be a serious detriment to a young woman who needs to
learn the ropes - the limitations, personalities, and resources of the
organization of which she is a part - and who would benefit, just as her
male counterpart does, from the casual atmosphere and casual discussions
that can result.

<P>Similarly, there may be a shortage of mentors, or role models, available
to the professional woman. Mentors are valuable people. They are like professional
parents who take more than a passing interest in a younger, less experienced
colleague. They offer constructive criticism and help develop professional
attitudes. Along with friendly colleagues, they can help you develop your
identity as a professional, your professional standards, and your self-confidence.
However, an older male can feel awkward being a mentor to a young female.
He may be overly protective and patronizing; he may fear that his professional
attention will be misconstrued by his co-workers or by her as an indication
of sexual interest. If he is her supervisor, he may not offer criticism
that can be of value because of his inexperience or awkwardness in dealing
with a female professional. He may be afraid that she will react by crying,
or he may believe she is not as serious about her career as men are and
thus does not welcome criticism.

<P>How do you seek a mentor? How do you get incorporated into the "old
boy" network? How do you convince others that you, too, are serious about
your career? Learn to spot the people who are in a position to help you
and are willing to do so. Let them know you respect their ability and you
seek their support. Have something to offer them in return: skills, enthusiasm,
and a record of doing good work. Be able to deliver as much as, or more
than, you promise and as much as you ask in return.

<P>In the work place, sexual harassment of some sort can be present in
the form of unwanted and uninvited propositions or unwelcome verbal comments
or physical contact. The casual relationship with your peers that gets
you into the "old boy" network may prompt numerous advances, since friendliness
on the part of a female colleague can be mistaken for an invitation or,
at least, an indication of availability. Travel to meetings or to remote
experimental sites with male colleagues can be awkward. Some companies
therefore discourage travel by the young female professional. As a result,
she may not form valuable contacts with the professional community.

<P>Do not be embarrassed or reluctant to turn down a sexual advance. Treat
it matter-of-factly, and do not advertise it to co-workers. The less firm
you are in your refusal and the more you make of such advances, the more
offense, however unjustified, will be generated by your refusal.

<P>If you believe you are being treated unfairly, it is probably best to
assume in the first instance that your difficulties are not the result
of sexual prejudice but are normal and surmountable. Then you can begin
dealing with them in an assertive and effective manner. Prejudice is often
so subtle you can never really know how great a factor it is in any human
interaction.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Solving the problem of
sexual prejudice</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The best way to solve a problem of sexual prejudice or sexual harassment
is in an assertive, nonpublic manner. If you have a legitimate gripe against
someone, discuss it with that person. Go to a person higher up who will
listen seriously to you only after you have failed to resolve the problem
in this manner. Try to be aware of potential problems and avoid them or
deal with them before they become large ones; try to choose as advisors
and employers those who are least likely to act in a prejudicial manner.
It does not help to have the "best" professor in the department as your
mentor if he works poorly with women or has antiquated ideas about women
and is unable or unwilling to change.

<P>If informal grievance procedures with your employer do not prove satisfactory,
you are entitled to assert your legal rights by filing a complaint with
the appropriate government agency. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 prohibits employers and labor organizations with greater than 15 employees
from discriminating on the basis of sex in hiring, firing, wages, promotions,
or any other conditions of employment. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 states
that men and women must be given equal pay for doing essentially the same
job. Public Law 95-555 requires that women affected by pregnancy, childbirth,
or related medical conditions be treated the same for all employment-related
benefits as persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability
to work. New Mexico state law states that "equality of rights under law
shall not be denied on account of the sex of any person." Agencies to contact
are the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 505 Marquette NW, Albuquerque,
NM 87102 and the New Mexico Human Rights Commission, 303 Bataan Memorial
Building, Santa Fe, NM 87503.

<P>Just as serious as these problems is the social training which creates
barriers in the mind of the female professional. Most women do not learn
in early childhood to assert themselves. Many do not take criticism easily,
and some interpret a challenge to their ideas as a personal insult. Many
women may wrongly react by assuming that all their difficulties at work
are manifestations of sexual prejudice and that all criticism is undeserved.
Many of us may not have played competitive games as children; we did not,
as a result, learn to cooperate and compete, to lead and follow, to give
and take criticism, to work with people we like and with people we dislike.
Furthermore, women may tend to draw a sharper line between their private
and professional lives; as a result, they hesitate to ask friends for professional
favors or for the advice that men seem to seek almost reflexively. Women
need to learn not to be reluctant to compete with men and to be good winners
as well as good losers.

<P>Recognize that many of the problems you encounter in your career are
also encountered by men to some extent. Some essential ingredients of professional
and personal maturation are the ability to accept constructive criticism,
the ability to discern your strengths and weaknesses clearly and objectively,
and a willingness to improve your strengths and reduce your weaknesses.
A woman professional, just like a male professional, must have a sturdy
ego to continue to put forth ideas that may be ignored and, particularly
in a scientific career, to be able to withstand the fairly frequent questioning
of her work that is an important part of the scientific process. You must
also develop the confidence to question the work of others when you believe
it to be in error; you must develop the ability to work amicably with co-workers
while maintaining respect and credibility.

<P>Learn to accept your shortcomings and to make a realistic assessment
of them. Do not be embarrassed by evidence of lack of perfection; acquire
respect for yourself even when you are fallible. Other women, including
your mother, and enlightened male colleagues can be helpful in promoting
your self-image.

<P>Finally, forget past offenses. Men have to learn, too. For older men,
especially those reared in a household where the mother never worked outside
the home and whose wives never did either, the adjustment to having a woman
as a co-worker can be difficult.

<P>Above all, the goals you should seek in your career are personal fulfillment
and happiness. In relations with others, it is important to be yourself,
to make decisions and act in a way that is right for you. Giving up your
womanhood should not be a prerequisite for success.
