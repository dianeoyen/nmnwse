<P>If you have ever had to contact someone that you don't know and ask
them to do something for you, you can appreciate how much easier that task
would have been if you had a networking relationship with them already
established.

<P>What is a network? We are all members of various networks. As a minimum,
you have family and school networks. Hobbies, sports, church, synagogue
or extracurricular activities provide additional networks. Your favorite
Web sites and chat rooms are also networks. Professional organizations,
like the New Mexico Network for Women in Science &amp; Engineering, Society
of Women Engineers, and Association for Computing Machinery are networks.

<P>An obvious example of a network is the New Mexico Network for Women
in Science &amp; Engineering. As a group of networked individuals, we exchange
information about job opportunities, management strategies, and technical
advancements, and we provide support, assistance, and encouragement to
one another. If you are attending an Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) Conference
and meet someone who is in a field you are interested in pursuing, you
can form a piece of a network with her.

<P>You don't have to personally know all the members of your network. If
you know one person in the network, mention that person's name to a new
acquaintance in the network. Just be careful and make sure that the relationship
between the person you are calling and the person you refer to is a good
one. Networking is one of the most effective ways of getting things done,
getting help you need, and getting ahead in the world. Your networks will
grow and expand with use.

<P>You may contact someone with a specific question, or send out a general
inquiry to everyone on
the network. Try it; you will be amazed at how well it works.
