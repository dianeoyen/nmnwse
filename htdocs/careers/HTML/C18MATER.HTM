<P>Materials scientists and engineers work with the materials involved
in manufacturing all products used in our society. These materials range
from well-known metals that have been around for ages such as iron, tin,
copper, and steel to many recently developed materials like polymers, ceramics,
superconductors, and high-performance alloys. Materials scientists study
how the properties of simple and complex materials can be controlled and
modified by chemistry changes as well as by variations in processing. They
also find ways to manufacture useful parts from these materials while maintaining
the desired properties.

<P>Materials science and engineering is important to our society. Many
technological advances have happened because new materials were invented
and/or better ways were found to manufacture existing materials. Automobiles
are being manufactured to be lighter and more fuel-efficient and with more
of their parts easily recyclable. Improvements in biomedical alloys have
made implants that last longer, and they are more easily accepted by the
body. The tiles on the space shuttle were specially designed to protect
the shuttle during reentry and to be strong enough to withstand the forces
of takeoffs and landings. New advances in plastics have made these materials
very versatile and more directly recyclable.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good materials
scientist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A good materials scientist is curious about why materials perform the
way they do and what can be done to make them better. Experiments play
a big part in materials research so a good scientist should be able to
run experiments accurately using many different types of equipment and
to keep good, detailed records. Since materials science is a mix of chemistry
and physics, interest in these subjects is a plus. Good communication skills
are always necessary, and computer skills are becoming increasingly important.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a materials
scientist like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Life as a materials scientist can be varied. Some scientists work in
laboratories using sophisticated equipment to fully analyze, test, and develop
new materials. Some scientists work mainly with small quantities of materials
using microscopes and small testing equipment, while others may work with
full factory setups making industrial products. Still other scientists
may work in the field or in a manufacturing plant to solve problems - there
only the experiments necessary to solve the problem are performed, and
decisions are made quickly.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a materials
scientist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Materials science is a broad field that can accommodate many interests.
To become a material scientist, you should take as much math and science
in high school as possible. Be sure to study chemistry, physics, and math,
such as trigonometry, algebra, and calculus. In college your undergraduate
education should include chemistry, physics, calculus, and classes in the
materials science field including microscopy, x-ray diffraction, heat,
fluid and mass transport, and if desired, engineering. Courses in areas
of specialization can be taken in graduate school to obtain M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Many types of organizations employ materials scientists and engineers.
Materials-producing industries such as metals, glass, ceramics, and plastics,
and manufacturing industries like automotive, aircraft, electronic, and
medical supplies are sources of employment. These can be large or small
companies and are located all over the country. Universities and national
laboratories are also good sources of employment. Since materials science
is such a broad and necessary field, there is a great deal of diversity
and options for employment.
