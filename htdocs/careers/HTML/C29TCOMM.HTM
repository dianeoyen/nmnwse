<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a technical communicator?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Whenever you talk, write, or make a hand gesture, you're communicating
information. When you write a procedure for safely operating equipment,
draw a diagram to show how a machine works, or explain to someone else
how to use a computer program, you're communicating technical information.
Technical communication is the literature of science and technology.

<P>Have you ever used a help screen in a computer program? Used a CD-ROM
to play a game? Surfed the Web by clicking on your favorite links? Used
a safety procedure? Assembled a bicycle? Read an article in Scientific
American? Used a diagram to help set up your family's computer? If you
have, you've used the product developed by a technical communicator.

<P>The information developed by science and technology must be recorded. Sometimes
it must be written in clear, uncomplicated language for nonspecialists
in the subject; sometimes it must be presented in great detail for specialists.

<P>Technical communicators produce material that conveys scientific and
technical information precisely, accurately, and clearly. The projects
that technical communicators work on are as varied as the companies and
laboratories that do the research. Although producing online documentation
or writing for technical publications may be a communicator's primary responsibility,
she may also be expected to produce speeches, news stories, scripts for
videos and films, or electronic publications.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good technical
communicator?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>If you can express yourself clearly in writing and speaking, and if
you are curious about science and technology, you have two important qualities
of a technical communicator. You should also enjoy interacting with people
and be enthusiastic about learning about new ideas.

<P>You must be able to do research and be persistent in finding facts;
able to listen, observe, and verify; and able to separate fact from hearsay
or fantasy. You must also be able to think clearly, pick out important
facts, and organize separate items into a clear, logical, and accurate
whole. And, of course, you must be able to write well.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a
technical communicator like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A technical communicator is typically a very busy person with many demands
on her time. Because much technical material explains current research,
introduces a new technology, or provides information necessary for others
to do their work, time is an important factor in most technical communication
jobs. A technical communicator is often working on several projects at
once, some with strict deadlines. Or, as documentation manager, she may
be responsible for just one large project - from concept to finished product.
A technical communicator may work with many people during the evolution
of a product: scientists, engineers, photographers, printers, and other
communicators such as technical artists, user interface specialists, production
team members, quality assurance people, and other specialists. She does
most of her work at a computer terminal.

<P>The rewards in technical communication come from seeing your work published
on paper or appearing on-line, from the challenge of taking complex technical
information and translating it into a useful product, and from working
with other people.

communicator?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The usual educational preparation for a career in technical communication
is a bachelor's degree with emphasis on both writing and science. Many
colleges and universities offer courses in technical communication, scientific
journalism, and technical art. Many schools have four-year bachelor's degree
programs in technical communication, and many universities offer master's
and Ph.D. degrees in the field.

<P>In high school you should take as many courses as you can in English,
the sciences, math, social sciences, and art. You should make a conscious
effort to build your vocabulary and learn to use words carefully and accurately.
If the university of your choice does not have a degree program in technical
communication, you should consider taking many courses in science and mathematics
and courses in composition, literature, journalism, graphic arts, and linguistics.
Such a program would prepare you well for selling your talent as a technical
communicator.

<P>An increasing amount of technical communication is produced digitally
in the "paperless office." The growth of nonprint, nonlinear information,
such as that found on the Web, is almost explosive. To meet the demands
of rapidly changing technologies and ways of finding and using information,
the technical communicator must also be accomplished in using computers
and computer technologies.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The sciences requiring technical literature and art include engineering,
physics, mathematics, chemistry, medicine, and the computer industry; but
there is a need for technical communication wherever scientific or engineering
work is done - at a research laboratory, a university, a chemical manufacturing
company, an assembly plant, or a software company. Producing technical
material has become a part of business and government. Hundreds of technical
journals and Web sites are devoted exclusively to scientific and engineering
subjects.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>For more information</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>There are many professional societies for the technical communicator.
Membership will prove profitable and pleasant, with the opportunity to
share your experiences with others engaged in similar activities. The principal
professional society for technical communicators is the Society for Technical
Communication. Professional groups for more highly specialized technical
communication include Nuclear Energy Writers Association, Association of
Petroleum Writers, Aviation-Space Writers Association, National Association
of Science Writers, American Medical Writers Association, and American
Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group for Documentation. On the
Web you can find these and other professional organizations that reflect
your own interests.
