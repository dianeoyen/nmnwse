<P>Going for a job interview is much like auditioning for a part in a play.
You get one opportunity to present yourself, and the overall impression
you make often determines whether or not you get the "part," the job.

<P>Often, small things that occur during an interview can mean the difference
between getting an offer and being rejected. Your basic goal is to spark
a positive response in the interviewer; to arouse her interest and keep
her attention. You can do a great deal to "set the stage" upon which you
will be judged. Your "makeup and costuming" (appearance), your entrance,
your "script" (resume or employment application), and your "delivery" (verbal
skills) can all contribute to the "curtain call," a job offer.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>First, dress the part.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Because the first impression you make on the interviewer will be visual,
do everything you can to make a good appearance. When you walk through
the door, you immediately project what type of worker you will be. Neat,
clean clothes and shoes are in; jeans, bare midriffs, and bare feet or
sloppy sandals are out. Dress conservatively; wear a suit, dress, or skirt
and blouse. Concentrate on good grooming: clean hair and nails, conservative
makeup, and a deodorant.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Second, write your script
and practice your lines.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>When you begin job hunting, prepare a typewritten resume and notes to
make filling out an employment application easier and faster. A resume,
necessary for all the jobs described here, should include your full name,
address, telephone number, and a chronological listing of your education
(name and location of schools, years attended, and when and if you graduated).
Your work experience, paid as well as volunteer, should include the company
or individual for whom you worked, address and phone number, job title,
and a brief description of your accomplishments. More detail on how to
write a resume is given in a separate article.

<P>In completing an employment application, write legibly and neatly, give
dates in chronological order, and answer all questions or write "NA" (not
applicable) if they do not apply to you. Never write "see resume"; this
can indicate that you lack cooperation skills. Take a pen and notebook
to the interview in case you are given information you would like to write
down.

<P>Practice your "lines" by preparing answers to some of the following
questions and rehearsing your answers with a family friend or someone who
works in the field you hope to enter. Your answers, as well as your self-assurance
and manner, are used by the interviewer in her evaluation of you. Be prepared
to answer the very general question, "Tell me about yourself." This question
is your opportunity to summarize briefly who you are and how well you can
do the job.

<P>Two basic questions you should be prepared to answer are, "Can you do
the job?" and "Will you fit in?" Additionally, you may be asked the following:
<br>&nbsp;

To answer the last question, learn as much as you can about the organization
to which you are applying. Find out what product it produces or what service
it offers and whether the company is successful. You may find some of this
information in the public library, from the Chamber of Commerce or the
Better Business Bureau, or from company annual reports to stockholders.
Parents, teachers, friends, or guidance counselors may also give you some
help.

<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Now that you are prepared,
make your entrance.</FONT></FONT></B>
<IMG SRC="CA06_P1.GIF" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">

<P>You may have already made an appointment, either by contacting the personnel
department or by answering a newspaper ad or job posting at school, or
you may have been referred by the Employment Security Commission, an employment
agency, or a school counselor. Make your entrance "on cue"; that is, do
not be late. Give yourself sufficient time to find the company if you have
never been there and to locate the interviewer's office.

<P>Once you are in the interviewer's office, try to relax. Make frequent
eye contact with her when you talk. Do not look at the floor, the ceiling,
or the pictures on the wall. Speak clearly and smile. Be friendly and positive.
Even if you have been rejected in past interviews, do not project a negative
attitude. Think before answering a question. Listen carefully to the question,
and ask for clarification if you do not understand it.

<P><B>Remember the interviewer's name</B> and use it during the interview.
Do not call the interviewer by his or her first name unless you are asked
to do so. Wait to sit until you are offered a chair or the interviewer
sits. Do not smoke.

<P><B>Ask questions during the interview,</B> but do not monopolize the
conversation. If you just wait for questions to be asked and dutifully
answer them, you have done nothing to set yourself apart from the other
applicants. Give the interviewer a chance to guide the discussion to cover
the points she wants to know. Make your answers complete, but do not ramble.
Ask questions about the job duties; the work hours; the pay; the company's
promotion policies, if it is a permanent job; and, if relevant, the assistance
offered for further training and schooling. Questions about vacation and
other time off may be asked, but do not give the impression that all you
are interested in is how many days you can take off. You want to sell yourself
as a person who is interested in learning how to do a job and in getting
it done.

<P>Try to <B>find out exactly what the requirements of the position are,</B>
so that you emphasize skills and experience that are relevant. Ask early
in the interview what is expected of you in the job. Do not be afraid to
sell your good points or to claim responsibility for projects on which
you have worked.

<P>While you should try to give clear answers to questions, you should
not be asked some questions. Some are prohibited by equal employment opportunity
laws; others, while not prohibited, should not be asked unless they are
related to the job for which you are being considered. For example, you
should not be asked your height and weight unless they are necessary for
performing the job. You should not be asked your age (but an employer may
ask if you are 18 years of age or older); your race, national origin, or
religion; your marital or family status, whether you plan to have children,
or whether you have an arrest record. If you are asked any of these questions
on an application, answer "NA" (not applicable). If they are asked verbally,
you should first politely ask their relevance to the job. If the interviewer
admits these questions have no relevance to the job, politely decline to
answer them.

<P>At the close of the interview, <B>ask the interviewer if she has any
concerns about your ability</B> to do the job. If she says "yes," ask what
they are and respond appropriately. If she says "no," say that if any concerns
do arise, you would appreciate an opportunity to respond to them. You can
then ask how soon you can expect to know whether or not you got the job
and if the interviewer would like you to call back to get this information.
Thank the interviewer, and make your exit.

<P>After the interview, <B>write down your impressions</B>. You may be
interviewed for more than one job, and these notes can help you decide
which position to accept. Write down the questions you were asked, your
answers, and what the interviewer said. Such information can be valuable
in preparing for future interviews. Also, because you may have more than
one interview with the same person or with the same company, you can be
consistent in what you say.

<P>If you are qualified for the job, have prepared yourself well, and put
your best foot forward during the interview, you stand a good chance of
succeeding. The most common reason companies give for choosing one applicant
over another is personality and overall impression of the candidate. Grades
are surprisingly low on the list. Companies say they want top graduates,
but they really want amiable, well-rounded workers who are highly motivated,
can communicate well, and have the skills that the company needs. Do not
be discouraged if you do not get the first job for which you apply. Review
each interview and decide what you did to make a good impression and what
you might do better. Then try again.
