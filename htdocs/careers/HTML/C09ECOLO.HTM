<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is an ecologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>An ecologist studies the interactions between organisms and their past,
present, and future environments. This information helps solve environmental
problems such as habitat damage and loss, species extinction, global climate
change, deforestation, and ozone layer depletion. Mysteries surrounding
the spread of diseases such as Hanta virus and Lyme disease have been unraveled
by ecologists. Other studies concern natural disturbances such as fire,
drought, flooding, and insect outbreaks. Ecologists also study the flow
of energy and the cycling of nutrients. There is a close link between ecology
and evolution: the abundance and distribution of organisms depends on both
their environment and evolutionary history. One example of an evolutionary
study is the interaction between some flowering plants and their insect
pollinators.

<P>Ecology includes the physiological response of individuals, population
structures and dynamics, interactions among species of plants and animals,
community organization, and ecosystem and landscape ecology. Subspecialties
focus on soil ecology, aquatic ecology or limnology, marine biology or
oceanography, terrestrial ecology, paleoecology (e.g., tree rings and pack
rat middens), and animal behavior such as the mating, feeding, and singing
of birds. There are also theoretical and statistical ecologists.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good ecologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Good ecologists are curious about the past and inspired by visions of
the future. They are capable of critical thinking and develop their observation
skills. Ecologists often either love the outdoors or are drawn to their
profession by social responsibility and an environmental ethic. An ecologist
must have good communication, mathematical, biological, and physical science
skills and be able to work as a team member to solve problems. Writing
skills are essential for getting project funds and for publishing exciting
results. Oral presentations are important to communicate results and provide
testimony to legislators and other decision-makers.

<P>The studies of some ecologists bring them to desolate and remote areas,
such as wilderness areas of Alaska or Antarctica. These beautiful outdoors
environments often have a special appeal that compensates for the lack
of modern conveniences. Some field work can be strenuous and in extreme
weather conditions that demand hardy and healthy individuals. Other work
environments include traditional laboratories, offices, computer pods for
mathematical modeling, and work stations for mapping with geographic information
system technology.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as an ecologist
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Ecologists address their hypotheses by observing and describing organisms
in their natural habitats or under experimental conditions. They may travel
to exciting places like coral reefs, tropical forests, mountains, deserts,
and lakes or streams. In addition to collecting field samples of soil,
water, air, and other physical factors, the ecologist may sample animal
or plant populations. The collected samples are then brought into the laboratory
to be identified, cataloged, and further studied. Field and laboratory
data are usually entered into a computer for analysis. After analyzing
the data, an ecologist may prepare reports and present talks at scientific
meetings. Ecologists often achieve career satisfaction by helping us all
to better understand and protect Earth's limited resources.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become an ecologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Ecology is a broad field that can accommodate many interests. To become
an ecologist, you should take as much math and science in high school as
possible. Be sure to study biology, chemistry, physics, and math such as
trigonometry, algebra, and calculus. In addition to general ecology, your
undergraduate education should include environmental studies, biological
sciences, chemistry, physics, calculus, and statistics. Courses in areas
of specialization can be taken in graduate school to obtain M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees. Ecologists also benefit from a broad undergraduate background
that can include geology, natural resource policy, engineering, geography,
computer science, and liberal arts.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Ecologists work in both research positions and applied areas such as
enforcement of environmental laws, forestry and range management, or restoration
ecology. Employers include a variety of federal agencies such as the Departments
of Agriculture and Interior, (Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau
of Land Management) and the Environmental Protection Agency. State governments
also hire ecologists, and New Mexico offers jobs as environmental associates,
specialists and scientists, environmentalists, and experts in the fields
of water, air, and hazardous waste management. Local governments, such
as Albuquerque's Environmental Heath Department, and environmental consulting
firms also provide career opportunities.

<P>Universities are great places to conduct ecological research and to
inspire new students. Studies of long-term ecological changes include two
sites in New Mexico that are part of a national network funded by the National
Science Foundation. NMSU's Jornada site near Las Cruces explores the causes
of desertification in semi-arid lands. UNM's Sevilleta site near Socorro
encompasses themes of biodiversity, the role of water in ecosystem processes,
carbon cycling, land use, and the effects of climate change.
