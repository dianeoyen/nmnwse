<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a pharmacist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A pharmacist works with drugs in their preparation and use to cure,
control, and prevent illness. The majority of pharmacists work in retail
pharmacies with the remainder working in such areas as hospitals, nursing
homes, manufacturing, biopharmaceutics, or research. In the health care
system, retail pharmacists dominate in the dispensing of drugs prescribed
by physicians. A pharmacist must work hand-in-hand with the doctors to
make sure that each patient receives the correct medication for his/her
condition. Pharmacists help patients understand how their medications will
control or cure their illnesses as well as how to properly take and store
the medications.

<P>A research pharmacist works with chemicals that possess desirable drug
effects and the challenge of putting these chemicals into finished products
such as tablets, injections, suspensions, suppositories, or patches. The
final drugs must meet the Federal Drug Administration requirements related
to stability, safety, and effectiveness.

<P>A pharmacist may choose a hospital or clinic setting where she deals
directly with doctors and nurses by showing them how to prepare and administer
drugs safely. She is also included on patient-care teams that evaluate
the patients' conditions and recommend drugs for their treatment.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good pharmacist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A good pharmacist is interested in the study of drugs and their effects
on the human body. She must love chemistry, biology, and mathematics. A
pharmacist must have the desire to work with people and be able to communicate
effectively with physicians. Most importantly, a good pharmacist must have
the desire and the patience to work with the elderly and with very ill
patients.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a pharmacist
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Working as a pharmacist is a very exciting experience. Knowing that
you play a role in helping a patient prevent or treat illness is very rewarding.
A retail pharmacist is well-respected, and is, according to a recent Gallup
Poll, "...the most trusted professional in America." That's quite a challenge
to live up to! Patients tell you intimate details of their lives and illnesses,
and you must respect their privacy and truly care about them. Pharmacists
help patients understand how their medications will control or cure their
illnesses as well as how to take and store medications properly.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a pharmacist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>If you are interested in pharmacy, you should take as many chemistry,
math, and science classes as possible in high school, including physics,
biology, algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. A pre-pharmacy program of
two years of select college classes is required before you can apply for
admission to the College of Pharmacy at the University of New Mexico. Classes
in the College of Pharmacy are limited to forty to forty-five students
per year, and you will be competing with several hundred students for admission,
so good grades are a must. Once you are accepted into the College of Pharmacy,
you must complete four years of pharmacy classes. After graduating with
a Pharm-D degree, you have to pass a national board examination and a state
laws exam. You must then apply for registration in the state where you
want to practice. Each state requires a law exam, but the pharmacy portion
of the exam will transfer among most states.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Pharmacists work in retail stores, drug manufacturing, research hospitals,
nursing homes, and education. A retail pharmacist may choose to work for
a national chain or own her own store. Hospital pharmacists may choose
a small clinic hospital or a large, complex health care facility to work
in. The armed forces offer pharmacists an officer's commission.

<P>New Mexico has a lot of great opportunities for employment in the rural
areas. A pharmacist can work full-time or part-time, or simply do relief
work when she wants to. Some pharmacists in the larger cities have full-time
jobs and pick up extra hours at a chain store that is open twenty-four
hours a day. There are a large variety of jobs available in pharmacy - something
for everyone.
