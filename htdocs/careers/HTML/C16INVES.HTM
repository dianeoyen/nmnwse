<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is an investment
analyst?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>You would find a job as an investment analyst, or stock broker, appealing
if you like excitement and constant change. An investment analyst gathers
pertinent facts on the past performance of management, markets, price/earnings
ratios, etc., of companies, compares these facts to those of other companies
in the same industry, and estimates a company's future performance. She
educates clients on the whole realm of investments; hence, she must be
fully informed about world and local political affairs as they relate to
the financial world, and she must be able to present facts on more than
40 investment vehicles. Tax investment planning, including real estate, 
oil and gas limited partnerships, and estate planning, can play an important
role in her job. Basically, an analyst is an idea giver, fitting a client's
needs and goals to particular investment vehicles, whether the client is
an individual investor or a bank, a labor union, a teachers' pension fund,
or a government agency.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good investment
analyst?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>An investment analyst must be able to read and digest a tremendous amount
of information in order to determine whether a given product fits a customer's
needs. She must be very self-motivated, have a high tolerance for stress,
be basically optimistic, enjoy interacting with and selling to the public,
and be able to keep accurate records of discussions and transactions with
a client. She must be able to make decisions quickly and accurately; a
good basic understanding of economics, mathematics, banking, and money
markets contributes to the ability to make decisions effectively.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as an investment
analyst like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>It is difficult to imagine a job that is more difficult, exciting, hectic,
frustrating, and rewarding. For example, as a fledgling stock broker you
can spend 60 - 70 hours per week building up a clientele. Your day begins
early, with a reading of current financial news (in the Wall Street Journal)
and research comments to prepare for questions clients might have concerning
financial investments. Once the financial markets open, a seemingly endless
string of phone calls commences: client and broker make decisions and orders
are entered. Dealing with problems that have come up and handling paperwork
make up most of the remainder of the day.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become an investment
analyst?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A college degree in business and/or economics is helpful but unnecessary
to be an analyst; nevertheless, it is increasingly important in the larger
securities firms. Course work in math, economics, banking, marketing, speech
communications, psychology, and sales is beneficial. If you become a broker,
an in-house training period usually prepares you for the uniform National
Association of Securities Dealers/Securities Exchange Commission examination
required by the federal government. In addition, most states require a
state examination in order to be licensed.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Brokerage houses, trust departments at banks, investment divisions of
insurance companies, and private investment advisor groups employ investment
analysts. Analysts are also increasingly in demand in large corporations.
Young women should seriously consider "Wall Street" as a career because
firms are bending over backwards to comply with the regulations of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
