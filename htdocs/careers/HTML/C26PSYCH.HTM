<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a psychologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A psychologist studies behavior and learning using observation, experimentation,
and survey techniques. Some psychologists teach, some conduct research,
and some apply their knowledge to problems of human behavior. Any combination
of these is also possible. Most people think of psychologists as clinicians
who test, diagnose, and treat emotional and behavioral problems. Clinical
psychology is one of the major areas of psychology, but it is far from
the only one. Developmental psychologists study normal patterns of development
in children, adolescents, adults, the aged, or other animal species. Experimental
psychologists increase our understanding of basic processes such as learning,
motivation, emotion, and perception. Industrial and organizational psychologists
aid in the selection and development of human resources in business or
government. School psychologists treat social and learning problems of
school children. Engineering psychologists design products, machinery,
and work or living areas with the "human factor" in mind. Forensic psychologists
work for the criminal and civil justice systems.

<P>An ability to work with people is important for most specialty areas.
Curiosity, a strong sense of
ethical responsibility, enjoyment
of the problem-solving process, and good verbal skills are major characteristics
of a good
psychologist. Psychology requires
creativity along with rigorous study and a desire to expand knowledge
as well as apply it. A
psychologist should have mathematical
and scientific skills as well as an interest in people, behavior, and
ideas.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a psychologist
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A psychologist's work is challenging and interesting. The hours of work
and intellectual energy needed can be great. Extensive work with disturbed
people can make heavy emotional demands. It can be frustrating to have
a client relapse or to have a carefully designed and executed study fail
to support your ideas about behavior. Yet the gratification of advancing
knowledge about behavior or helping others help themselves is not only
satisfying but even exhilarating.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a psychologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A psychologist has different training than either a psychiatrist or
a counselor. Psychiatry requires a medical degree with a specialization
in psychiatry. Counselors concentrate on developing counseling and therapeutic
skills in their advanced training. In contrast, a clinical psychologist
must obtain a Ph.D. or Psy.D. in order to develop research skills as well
as counseling and therapeutic skills. Clinical, consulting, and forensic
psychology often require several years of supervised experience beyond
the Ph.D. Many states, including New Mexico, require both a Ph.D. and supervised
work experience before you can be certified to practice independently as
a psychologist.

<P>Almost all jobs require at least a master's degree, and a large majority require
a Ph.D. degree. College teaching requires a Ph.D., as does most research.
Junior college teachers should have at least a master's degree; more often than
not, a Ph.D. degree is required. With a bachelor's or master's degree,
you can teach in high school or work in government or business. For example,
a bachelor's degree could lead to a job as an advertising consultant. Few
high school teachers concentrate solely on psychology; instead, most obtain
certification in the social sciences.

<P>In high school you should take college-preparatory courses in math and
the social and natural sciences to develop your research and analytic skills.
A solid background in algebra is needed to understand how tests are developed
and how scores should be interpreted. Trigonometry and calculus are important
to understand the multivariate statistics increasingly in use by social
scientists. A course in computer programming is also helpful. Take a broad
sampling of psychology courses in college, even if you have already chosen
your specialty. Some of the greatest advances in each area of psychology
have been made by combining concepts from other areas, and you will be
better able to discuss your work with people from varying backgrounds.
Take laboratory courses to learn methods of inquiry and problem solving,
and develop your math and science skills with courses in statistics, computer
programming, and research methods. Do not neglect the humanities. Some
of the most insightful ideas about people, behavior, and the mind come
from philosophy, literature, and the arts.

<P>In graduate school, traineeships
can provide valuable and often necessary experience in most areas of psychology.
Internships are a major component of all teaching and clinical practice
programs, and a few corporations offer internships in engineering and industrial
psychology.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<IMG SRC="C26_P1.GIF" align="right">

<P>Psychologists are employed by universities, large industries, government,
medical and health facilities, and consulting firms. As in other fields,
opportunities for employment in four-year colleges and universities are
shrinking. Many clinicians choose to work outside academia in private practice,
health organizations, school systems, or large businesses. Managed behavioral
health care is slowly but steadily changing opportunities for clinicians
to work, increasing opportunities for Master's level clinicians and decreasing
them at the doctoral level.
