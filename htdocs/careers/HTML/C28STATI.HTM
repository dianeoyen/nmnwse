<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a statistician?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The stereotype of a statistician tabulating and summarizing masses of
numbers fails to capture the diversity and creativity of statistical work.
A statistician does collect and analyze data, but there are many aspects
of this work, and as a statistician you will be involved in all of them.
You will design sample surveys and laboratory experiments to maximize the
information gained within time and budget constraints. You will modify
standard analytical techniques so that they can be applied to the available
data. You will also spend time educating students and colleagues about
what statistics can and cannot do and learning from those colleagues about
their problems.

<P>Statisticians can be classified as "applied" or "mathematical," although
those with advanced degrees find that they wear either hat as the occasion
requires. An applied statistician primarily works at solving problems for
and with clients from other disciplines, frequently as a member of a multidisciplinary
team. A mathematical statistician evaluates existing statistical techniques,
devises new ones, and explores the underlying mathematical theory, often
within the statistics or mathematics department of a university or other
research institution.

Gertrude M. Cox, the 'first Lady of Statistics', was a major international figure in the field of statistics and a beloved mentor to many statisticians. The ASA offers a graduate scholarship in her honor. View her biography online at<br>

<P>The range of study areas in which statistics can be applied is enormous,
and good statisticians take an interest in a broad spectrum of scientific
and sociological problems. While they usually specialize to some extent,
for example in applications related to medicine, engineering, or economics,
they are versatile and enjoy learning about new areas of application throughout
their lifetimes.

<P>A critical skill is the ability to extract the important features of
a problem from a mass of facts. A statistician must be at ease with mathematical
concepts and must be able to formulate new problems in mathematical terms.
In the last two decades, high-speed computers and new data-visualization
techniques have revolutionized statistics, so it is essential to know how
to use computers effectively.

<P>Although they may prefer working with "things" rather than people, statisticians
must be able to communicate with people outside their field as well as
with their statistical colleagues. They must be both willing and able to
go more than halfway to understand the problems and constraints of the
researchers and other clients with whom they work, and to explain statistical
conclusions to those with little or no statistical training.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a statistician
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The long-term rewards come both from being part of the discovery process
and from helping managers, teams, and researchers to make sound, data-based
decisions. On a day-to-day basis, statisticians take pleasure in revealing
the structure underlying a set of data and in using logic and mathematics
to solve real-world problems. Like most jobs, statistics also requires
a fair amount of plugging along at more mundane tasks, debugging computer
programs, or proofreading reports. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect
is the multiple demands on your time, keeping several projects going at
once, and sometimes feeling unable to do justice to any of them.

<P>If you are associated with a university, you will be teaching and helping
students. As a statistician in any organization, you will spend time both
on consulting on quick problems and learning in depth about new ones. You
will need to review current journals both to find the right technique for
a new problem and to keep abreast of new developments. You will probably
do some traveling to meetings and short courses in the course of your consulting
work.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a statistician?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A few universities offer a bachelor's degree in statistics, but many
statisticians obtain their bachelor's degree in another field, such as
a natural science, economics or sociology, mathematics, or computer science.
With any degree that includes a strong background in mathematics (calculus,
linear algebra, one or two courses in probability and statistics, and some
computer science), you can work with other statisticians, conducting surveys
and running standard data analyses.

<P>Most statisticians complete a master's degree, which equips them to
work independently on applied statistical problems. Here the training is
more specialized, including several courses on statistical theory and methods
as well as valuable consulting experience under the guidance of a faculty
member. It is important to take courses in one or more areas where you
might apply statistics (e.g., in the natural or social sciences) and to
learn to use the computer creatively as well as being familiar with the
commercially available statistical software. As part of your general background,
you might also take courses in technical writing and in the history and
philosophy of science.

<P>To become a mathematical statistician, teach at a university, or obtain
a job in which you devote part of your time to research, you will probably
need a Ph.D. degree. This involves further course work in specialized areas
of statistics as well as writing a dissertation that represents an original
contribution to the field of statistics.

<P>The demand for statisticians continues to be strong. Industry employs
about two thirds of all statisticians in many kinds of work: pharmaceutical
research, quality control and reliability engineering, development of agricultural
products, marketing and forecasting, and dozens of other areas. Government
is concerned about demography, labor force surveys, natural resource estimation,
and environmental monitoring, among other areas, and currently employs
10% to 15% of working statisticians. Established individuals with advanced
degrees occasionally go into business for themselves, consulting for industry
and government. Universities and colleges need statisticians with advanced
degrees who will teach and collaborate with students and faculty in other
fields.
