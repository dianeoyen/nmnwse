<P>Juniors, if you haven't started to look at colleges, it would be best
to start now.

<P>How, you say? Well, I'll tell you: go to the counselor's office as soon
as you can and give him or her a list of colleges that you might be interested
in. If you don't do it this school year, there's no way you can get the
best deal possible. If you don't have a case of wanderlust and don't mind
staying in state, then it's simple. You can wait to get your scholarship
applications and admissions forms early next school year.

<P>If you are under the impression that scholarships are exclusively for
the smart kids, you're wrong. Anyone graduating from high school can get
a virtually free education, that is, in New Mexico, of course.

<P>It's simple. All you have to do is apply for all the scholarships that
you quality for, and if you don't get one of those, you automatically receive
the Lottery Scholarship. It may seem like a lot of work, but in actuality
it only takes a couple of hours. It's the easiest money you'll ever make.

<P>Now, for all the seniors: If you have done nothing toward college at
this point, go talk to your counselor and pray.
