<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is assertion?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Assertion involves standing up for your rights and tactfully expressing
thoughts, feelings, and beliefs in a direct, honest way that does not violate
the rights of another person. An assertive person feels good about herself.
She is capable of expressing both positive and negative feelings and opinions
in an appropriate way. Rather than relying on fate or good fortune, the
assertive person acts in a way to get her owns needs met while respecting
the rights of others.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What do we mean by passive,
aggressive, and assertive behavior?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>In dealing with situations in our lives, we have three ways to respond
- passively, aggressively, or assertively. Let's look at the differences
between these response possibilities. When you are passive, you stifle
your feelings; you rely on others to guess what you want, and you hope
you will get what you want. An aggressive person responds in whatever way
works - uses threats, manipulation, sarcasm, and fighting, often causing
bad feelings in others. With assertiveness you speak directly and openly,
you ask with confidence and without undue anxiety for what you want, and
you have respect for yourself and others.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How assertive are you?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Perhaps you think you are already an assertive person. Read the following
statements. Take an honest assessment of how many statements you can answer
with a "yes."
<br>&nbsp;
<table border=0>
<tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
In class, you are unclear about something your teacher has said. Will you
ask for clarification?</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
A friend has a habit of always finishing your sentences, and this habit
is starting to bother you. Can you express your anger constructively without
exploding?</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
Your family is pressuring you to go into a certain career. You have no
interest in this field. Are you able to discuss this openly with them?</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
Your parents have been arguing a great deal. Are you able to express your
concern and discomfort to them?</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
You have been dating someone for about three months and have decided you'd
rather not see him anymore. Will you express your feelings to him honestly?</td></tr>
</table>

<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How can you become more assertive?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Increasing your ability to be assertive may involve examining your belief
system. If you still hold a belief that you should never upset anyone or
never disagree with anyone, you may have difficulty being assertive. Another
belief you may hold is that people will not like nor accept you if you
express an opinion that is different from theirs. Or you may be saying
to yourself, "expressing my feelings is more trouble than it's worth." You
may keep such a tight lid on your feelings that you're afraid you will
explode if you express how you really feel.

<P>A new more helpful way of thinking may include some of the following
beliefs:
<br>&nbsp;
<table border=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr><td valign=top><img src="R_HAND2.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
My needs are just as important as anyone else's.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><img src="R_HAND2.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
It is okay to make reasonable requests of other people.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><img src="R_HAND2.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
If I express myself now, I will avoid more problems in the long run.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><img src="R_HAND2.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
I am not responsible for how other people feel.</td></tr>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>
Responding in an assertive manner takes practice. The more you practice
the better you will get at expressing your feelings and needs in a calm,
controlled way. By being assertive you will get your needs met, allow others
the same, and enjoy more satisfying relationships with important people
in your life.
