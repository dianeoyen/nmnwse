<P>A dentist diagnoses and treats diseases and trauma to the teeth, gums,
and jaw bones. Modern dentistry now gives her many options for the removal
of decay and materials used for fillings. She must have a broad understanding
of oral surgery, orthodontics, pedodontics (treating children), root canal
treatment, gum treatment, cosmetic corrections, fabrication of oral prosthesis
for the replacement of missing teeth, and many other techniques.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good dentist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Whether removing decay with a dental drill or laser and placing a filling,
or removing a wisdom tooth, a dentist must have good manual dexterity,
a good judgment of space and shape, and a high level of diagnostic ability.
Dentistry is teamwork. A dentist will work closely with her assistant,
who provides her "third and fourth hands"; a dental hygienist, who cleans
teeth; her lab people who make crowns, dentures, and other oral prostheses;
and also her staff, which can include receptionists and office managers.
She must also be very understanding about her patients' needs and anxieties.
The ability to communicate openly with both her staff and patients is essential.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a dentist
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A dentist spends most of her time treating patients; she may also choose
to do some of her own laboratory work. Most dentists are their own bosses,
and so they will also spend time managing their staffs and being businesswomen.
Being self-employed, they can choose their own hours; these will usually
correspond to regular business hours, though a dentist may choose to work
evenings or weekend hours. A small percentage of dentists will teach or
do research. Some will work for public dental health programs. More dentists
are now working as employees for large health corporations. This takes
away some of your ability to "be your own woman," but it also may lessen
the pressures of being a "boss." Above all, you are a health care giver
and a craftswoman; your patients appreciate you very much when you strive
to do your best for them.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a dentist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Becoming a dentist requires four years of college and graduation from
a dental school, which is four more years. Courses in dental science, clinical
technique, anatomy, microbiology, biochemistry, physiology, pathology,
and many other sciences are taken the first two years of dental school.
During the last two years the dental student will treat patients in a clinic.
Both college and dental school are very demanding periods of study, requiring
a lot of hard work and dedication. To be licensed in most states you must
pass practical and written exams. If she chooses, a dentist can continue
in school to become a specialist in a particular field of dentistry.

<P>Predental education in college should include courses in science and
humanities. In high school, a young woman should take as many classes in
biology, chemistry, math, and health as possible so that she will be better
prepared for college courses.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Jobs are not hard to find, most are in private offices. One may also
join the armed forces or public health programs. Because the financial
outlay required to set up a dental practice is very high, most new dentists
work for and buy into an already established private practice. Dentists
have the ability to earn a very good living and can retire early if they
are careful businesswomen. They can also choose to work part-time for another
dentist or in a clinic and thus still be able to raise and enjoy a family.
