<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is an arch&aelig;ologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>An arch&aelig;ologist is someone who has an unquenchable curiosity about
past cultures and people: how they lived, what they ate, how they were
organized socially and politically, what they made, and where they lived.
Arch&aelig;ologists are members of the larger field of anthropology, but unlike
most anthropologists, arch&aelig;ologists are concerned about past behaviors
and lifeways. Like detectives, arch&aelig;ologists piece together past lifeways
by examining the evidence left behind in the ground, on the ground, in
dry caves, and under the ocean. This evidence includes pottery, stone tools,
the ruins of ancient buildings and ships, animal bones, trash, old garden
plots, plant remains and pollen, and even the land form on which the ancient
ruins are found.

<P>In order to answer questions as simple as, "Where did the clay used
to make this pot come from?" or as complicated as, "What caused empires
to arise in Peru and Mexico, but not in North America?", arch&aelig;ologists
collaborate with a number of other scientists including geologists, chemists,
geomorphologists, architects, linguists, historians, biologists, and other
specialists.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good arch&aelig;ologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A good arch&aelig;ologist must be someone who is willing to be patient, exacting,
attentive to detail, a good and thorough researcher, a good writer, a good
public speaker, a good analyst, and a good synthesizer. Also important
is the ability to work as a team member since many arch&aelig;ologists collaborate
with other specialists. A tolerance for rugged living and working conditions
is necessary because most arch&aelig;ological field work is often conducted
in remote areas. The weather can be hot and humid, cold and wet, dry and
hot; the terrain can be rugged or flat, and the vegetation dense as the
jungle or sparse as the desert. Insects, plants, and animals can be trying
and vicious in all of these environments.

<P>Most importantly, to be a good arch&aelig;ologist, as with any career, you
must be enthusiastic about your chosen career and be able to communicate
your enthusiasm and love for your work to others.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as an arch&aelig;ologist
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Exciting. Yes, there can be periods of boredom or tedium as you face
the never-ending analysis of ceramic. There can also be periods of frustration
when all your data appears to conflict. However, the joy of solving the
puzzle, putting the last piece in place, or finishing the ceramic analysis
is immense. There is also the excitement of meeting new people, going to
new places, and participating in exciting, groundbreaking research.

<P>As an arch&aelig;ologist, you have a variety of job possibilities including
museum director, museum curator, professor, contract arch&aelig;ologist, or
owner of your own contract firm. A typical day can vary depending on the
job you take, but there are many similarities. A university professor may
spend the day lecturing, analyzing chipped stone or ceramics in the lab,
attending meetings, supervising students, writing up the results of field
work, or excavating a site. A museum director could spend the day doing
similar things as the professor or have a public speaking engagement, develop
new exhibits, or curate an exhibit (select the objects for display). A
person working for a contract firm could spend the day writing up a report,
analyzing artifacts in the lab, excavating a site or walking 10 to 15 miles
as part of field survey crew locating arch&aelig;ological sites. As the owner
of a contract firm, you could spend the day acquiring contracts, writing
grants, and making the payroll.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become an arch&aelig;ologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>First you need to decide what type of job you might be interested in
doing. In arch&aelig;ology, the more education you have, the more responsibility
and the higher-paying the job. For instance, if you have a bachelor's degree
from a college in anthropology/arch&aelig;ology, you can usually work as part
of a field crew or lab crew surveying, excavating, and sorting. However,
with just a bachelor's degree you may not find yourself in charge of running
the field crew, writing reports, or directing the analysis. With more education
and experience, at the master's level (graduate school), you will be writing
reports and directing the field crew or the lab work. You can also become
a museum curator or teach arch&aelig;ology as part of the curriculum at the
primary and secondary school levels. To actually write the grant, develop
the research design, and become a university professor or museum director,
you should have a doctorate (Ph.D.) in anthropology.

<P>So, what do you take in school? It depends on what you want to do in
arch&aelig;ology. Start off in high school by taking as many courses as possible
in math, science, computers, English, literature, and writing. Learning
a second language such as Spanish is also helpful.

<P>In college focus on gaining a broad understanding of the entire field
of anthropology. All arch&aelig;ologists obtain their degrees in anthropology
in the U.S. so arch&aelig;ologists are essentially cultural anthropologists.
If you have decided not to go to graduate school, be sure to take courses
in college that will benefit your chosen career. If you are interested
in mapping, take geomorphology and cartography. If you are interested in
computer applications in arch&aelig;ology, take courses in geographic information
systems and computer programming. If you are interested in museum work,
take courses in museum operations and management and registration procedures.
If you are interested in managing a contract firm, take courses in management
and business. Develop your education plan based on the type of job you
wish to have in arch&aelig;ology.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>There are private and nonprofit contract arch&aelig;ology firms. There are
university, college, and junior college academic positions. There are research
positions at universities, colleges, museums, private foundations, and
firms. There are a number of state and federal agencies that hire arch&aelig;ologists
to do environmental impact studies and arch&aelig;ological assessments before
authorizing building, logging, mining, or otherwise disturbing an area.
These agencies include city governments, the Bureau of Land Management,
the Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Forest Service, the National
Park Service, state monuments, state land offices, and fish and wildlife
departments.
