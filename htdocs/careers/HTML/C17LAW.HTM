<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a lawyer?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A lawyer helps others resolve legal disputes; that is, a lawyer has
been trained to listen to a set of&nbsp; facts, to analyze those facts
in order to identify the legal questions involved, and if asked, then to
represent a client's interest. The resolution of a legal dispute can take
place in a courtroom, or lawyers can negotiate and settle differences out
of court. Also, a lawyer sometimes acts as a counselor and advisor in planning
future conduct to avoid legal disputes.

<P>Lawyers vary in the kinds of legal questions they handle. Some specialize
in criminal law, representing clients accused of crime. Other lawyers specialize
in tax law, giving advice about the wide variety of taxes collected by
state and federal government. Intellectual property attorneys represent
clients who wish to obtain or protect rights in patents, trademarks, copyrights,
or trade secrets. Still others specialize in property law, advising clients
on buying or selling a house, or in estate law, making wills and trusts,
for example.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good lawyer?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The same habits of mind and temperament that make a good professional
also make a good lawyer. A lawyer, like a physicist, needs common sense,
a good imagination, and a curiosity about the way people and things work.
In law, however, some qualities of mind and temperament are uniquely important.
First, you need to be careful. Much of law is tedious, detail can be significant,
and all lawyer's jobs require preparation. You must be sufficiently conscientious
to handle a lot of paperwork. Second, you need to be flexible. Often a
problem cannot be resolved in the manner the lawyer first tries or even
thinks is best. Lawyers need not only the imagination to conceive alternative
resolutions but also the temperament to change approaches. Third, you need
a tolerance for ambiguity. Sometimes there are no answers, and you must
develop a solution or choose a course of action for a client that seems
safe even though the legal ramifications are not entirely clear. Many people
find this ambiguity exhilarating; some find it terribly frustrating.

<P>Finally, a lawyer must be able to communicate easily and well in writing
and in professional dialogue; she must be a good reader and a good listener.
Not every lawyer, however, has to be a brilliant speaker. Effective speaking
can be learned, and for most lawyers, written advocacy and face-to-face
negotiation play a larger role than does argument in court.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a lawyer
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Unlike the criminal defense lawyer Perry Mason, the average lawyer rarely
goes to court but rather spends time doing research in a law library, talking
to clients, and writing letters, legal arguments, or papers to be filed
in court or an administrative agency. Much time is spent talking to other
lawyers, either negotiating with an opponent or consulting with colleagues.
Lawyers also participate in bar association activities or in community
affairs, such as speaking to lay groups interested in legal issues. Many
run for elective office or serve as judges.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a lawyer?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>To become a lawyer, you need a law degree, and you need to be admitted
to practice law in a particular state. To become a patent attorney, you
must also have a science or engineering background and be admitted to practice
before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Rules for admission to the
Bar vary considerably from state to state, and admission to practice in
one state does not automatically entitle a lawyer to practice elsewhere.
Most states require a law school graduate to pass a bar examination before
issuing a license to practice law.

<P>Admission to law school usually requires a bachelor's degree, and the
applicant almost always takes an aptitude test, the Law School Admission
Test (LSAT), which does not require knowledge of the law.

<P>The most worthwhile high school courses are those that develop skills
in careful reading and exact writing. The development of skills and habits
conducive to legal reasoning is more important than the subject matter.
Take courses that develop a broad cultural background; the ability to organize
materials and communicate results; habits of thoroughness, intellectual
curiosity, and scholarship; and verbal skills. Courses in literature, language,
speech, composition, and logic cultivate such skills. Questionnaires several
years ago asked leaders of the Bench and Bar which prelaw college subjects
they considered most valuable. The following subjects were listed, in order
of preference: English language and literature, government, economics,
American history, mathematics, English history, Latin, logic and the scientific
method, and philosophy. Accounting (not bookkeeping) and public speaking
were also recommended.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A law degree represents a very flexible career choice. Most attorneys
are in private practice; many, including judges, are in government service;
some are employed by private business; and the rest are in fields such
as stock brokerage, banking, teaching, and politics. Several famous television
journalists have law degrees.

<P>Lawyers are distinguishable in terms of whether they represent individuals
or institutions. Some work for the state, federal, or city government.
Others work for corporations, such as General Motors or Exxon, as "in-house"
counsel on a permanent basis. Lawyers who represent numerous clients are
said to be "in private practice." They may work in a large firm of 100
lawyers or more, in cities such as New York, Dallas, or Chicago; as sole
practitioners; or in a small or medium-sized firm. Albuquerque's largest
private law firm employs about 50 lawyers.

<P>There is no standard wisdom on where new openings are likely to occur.
Certainly some of the largest cities seem to be, or to be rapidly becoming,
"over-lawyered." New or migrating lawyers in growing areas like the Southwest,
however, seem to find jobs with little difficulty. Income varies greatly
with location, experience, area of specialization, and education.
