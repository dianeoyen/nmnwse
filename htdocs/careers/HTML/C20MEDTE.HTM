<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a medical technologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Medical technology is concerned with laboratory tests used in the prevention,
diagnosis, and treatment of disease. These tests and analyses are performed
by a medical technologist (MT) or a medical laboratory technician (MLT).
A medical technologist is knowledgeable in all areas of clinical laboratory
work and is able to perform all routine procedures as well as specialized
tests requiring more complex techniques. The MT makes independent decisions
concerning the quality of laboratory results. Responsibilities often include
education of peers, students, and subordinates; research and development
of new techniques; and laboratory supervision. The MLT performs most routine
laboratory procedures under the supervision of a medical technologist.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good medical
technologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The medical technologist (and MLT) must possess the ability to work
well with people and the desire to be of service to others. She must demonstrate
the highest degree of integrity - honesty, confidentiality, and responsibility
- in all areas of her professional and private life. Working under stress
while maintaining manual dexterity and logical thinking is essential. Accurate
and precise laboratory results require neatness, a high degree of persistence,
and a capacity for patient, thorough effort. An interest in and an aptitude
for science and mathematics are also helpful.

<P>A research and development (R&amp;D) medical technologist must be creative
and have a strong science background. Medical product development can be
very challenging and exciting. To become an R&amp;D scientist, one can have
a B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. degree in any area of science.

<P>Few people encounter a medical technologist unless they are hospitalized,
and even then they may not realize that the blood specimen taken in the
early morning is sent to the laboratory where a technologist or technician
analyzes it to help monitor conditions in many parts of the body. By treating
the sample in various ways to measure the constituents, a technologist
aids the physician in assessing the functions of vital organs and their
responses to therapy.

<P>Medical technology is a rapidly advancing and changing field in which
automated equipment such as electronic cell counters, computers, and self-regulating
chemical analyzers have joined the test tube, the centrifuge, and the microscope
as laboratory tools. Technologists must not only master the use of these
instruments but also handle their routine maintenance in order to forestall
critical work stoppages. They must continually monitor the quality of the
performance of these tools, or the results obtained will be incorrect.

<P>Most MTs and MLTs specialize by working in one of several diverse departments
such as blood banking, chemistry, hematology, microbiology, or serology.
They are among the physician's most valuable assistants in problem-solving,
tracking down the causes of disease, checking the effect of antibodies
on various microbes, exploring the hormonal status of sterile women, testing
for pregnancy, or measuring the clotting capacity of blood. Some technologists
become supervisors. They are responsible for orienting new employees, instructing
trainees, managing supplies, monitoring work quality, maintaining records,
and keeping laboratory procedures up to date.

<P>A research scientist in the field of medical technology creates medical
products to help improve health care. She will first research a known problem
in a hospital, such as a need for a product that will provide more rapid
test results or possibly a new instrument to perform a test or procedure
quickly and accurately. Once the problem is identified, a team will develop
and test many designs to try to solve the problem. The resulting product
will need to work effectively in many types of conditions; it must be easy
to use and have a long shelf life. It is likely to take many years to develop
a new medical product.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a medical
technologist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A medical technologist needs a bachelor's degree in a laboratory science
or a related area; the curriculum includes structured clinical training
in medical technology in a hospital laboratory. Academic programs of universities
vary so widely that no typical course outline can be given. Nevertheless,
certification requires that courses prior to clinical training include
16 hours of chemistry (including organic and/or biochemistry), 16 hours
of biological science (including microbiology and immunology), and one
course in college-level mathematics. Training programs vary in length and
structure; most are a year long (50 weeks, 40 hours per week) and replace
the fourth year of college or are taken after the B.S. degree is earned.
Upon completing training, the graduate is eligible to take state or national
certifying examinations given by agencies such as the Board of Registry
(American Society of Clinical Pathologists) and the National Certification
Agency of Medical Laboratory Personnel.

<P>To undertake such a university curriculum, the student should have taken
high school biology, chemistry, and mathematics through trigonometry, with
physics as an optional but useful addition.

<P>A medical laboratory technician must complete an associate degree curriculum
in laboratory science, including a structured training program in all areas
of the clinical laboratory; such a degree program is usually given by community
colleges. The graduate takes state or national certifying examinations
at the MLT level.

<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>In their first jobs, most technologists and technicians work in hospital
laboratories; nevertheless, positions are available in other health-related
or scientific areas. Laboratory professionals may also work in private
or industrial laboratories, in public health agencies, in health maintenance
organizations, in research or teaching institutions, or in medical programs
such as the Peace Corps, VISTA, or Project Hope. Availability of jobs other
than in hospitals depends on geographic location, job description, and
qualifications. The job outlook is very good and will continue to be good,
although opportunities vary among cities and states. Locations with the
greatest demand include inner-city facilities and rural areas. Like the
job market, salaries vary with location, education, experience, and responsibilities.
