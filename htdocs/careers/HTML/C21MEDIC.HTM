<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a medical doctor?</FONT></FONT></B>

<img src="C21_P2.JPG" alt="skeleton" align="right" width="104" height="365">
<P>A medical doctor is a practitioner of the healing arts. She examines
patients, analyzes the results of laboratory tests, diagnoses and treats
the patient's medical condition, prescribes drugs, and advises the patient
about methods of preventive health care. A medical doctor differs from
a pure scientist in that medicine is a marriage of the biological sciences
and the humanities. An M.D. must apply her scientific knowledge in the
context of patient care.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good medical
doctor?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A doctor is broadly trained in the sciences and the scientific method.
A good M.D. must have an interest in and an understanding of how the human
body functions. She should have a desire to work with people as well; compassion
and honesty are as important as inquisitiveness and scientific aptitude.
As in all fields, common sense, too, is helpful. The good doctor listens
to the patient and is aware of the patient's feeling about the medical problem, not
just the problem itself. She must be able to recognize what are the most
important questions to ask a patient and what are the best tests to perform
to arrive at a diagnosis.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a medical
doctor like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Life as a medical doctor can vary depending on your field of practice.
A general practitioner, internist, pediatrician, or obstetrician-gynecologist
provides primary care of patients. Specialists such as ophthalmologists
(eye physicians and surgeons), otorhinolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat
doctors), orthopedists (bone doctors), endocrinologists (gland and hormone specialists),
and dermatologists (skin doctors) diagnose and treat problems specifically
related to their areas of specialization.

<P>Depending on the specialty, you may have regular office hours or you
may receive emergency phone calls in the middle of the night. As a doctor,
you can have an individual practice or a group practice, or you can do
all your medical work at a hospital. Some M.D.s are totally involved in
patient care, others in teaching at a medical school. Many combine the
two and spend part of their time teaching medical students, interns, and
residents.

<P>Another important function of an M.D. is to serve on various panels
with colleagues and other members of the medical profession and on committees
such as the medical malpractice panel of the state medical society or on
hospital committees, such as patient care or cost containment. A large
part of your time must be spent in continuing education to maintain your
license as an M.D. as well as certification in your area of specialization.
The field of medicine changes so rapidly that you must keep up with the
current state of the art in order to provide up-to-date care for your patients.

<P>The advantages of a career in medicine can include the satisfaction
in the development of a trusting and lasting relationship with a patient.
A doctor is often involved in life-and-death type responsibilities; coping
with the severe illness or death of a young child can be very wearing.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become a medical
doctor?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>To become a medical doctor, you need a college education and graduation
from a school of medicine. Medical school generally takes an additional
four years beyond college. Specialization takes further training. In ophthalmology,
for example, residency takes three additional years of training and, until
recently, a year of internship prior to the residency. Other specialties,
such as surgery, can require six years or more.

<P>All doctors must be licensed by their respective state boards of medical
examiners. Nevertheless, in most states renewal of licenses is a mere formality.
New Mexico and several other states, however, make renewal of the license
to practice medicine contingent upon completion of a prescribed amount
of accredited postgraduate study in medicine.

<P>You must take many science courses, particularly in the biological sciences,
in both high school and college. Nevertheless, there are qualities besides
scientific knowledge that make a good doctor. You can run the risk of becoming
so intent on making good grades in the sciences that other areas are neglected.
Be realistic and understand that competition for entry into medical school
is stiff. A broad education in high school is advisable before you must
begin to concentrate on the required courses in college. High school courses
should include English, mathematics, biology, and chemistry. Since requirements
differ from school to school, determine the various college courses necessary
for admission to different medical schools.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>More doctors are needed in the area of family practice or general practice,
i.e., the area of "primary care." Openings in the specialties, in general,
are less common. Small towns are more in need of doctors than large cities;
the South and Midwest are more in need than the east and west coasts. Salaries
are extremely variable depending on location, type of practice, and type
of specialty.
