<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+3>After High School</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>Three basic educational options are available after high school:

<P>
A <B>certificate program</B> in a vocational field usually requires 12
to 18 months to complete.

<P>
An <B>associate degree program</B>, Associate of Arts (A.A.) or Associate
of Science (A.S.), usually requires two years for completion.

<P>
A <B>bachelor's degree program</B> such as Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor
of Science (B.S.), or Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) usually
takes four years.


<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Option 1: Certificate programs</FONT></B>

<P>For students choosing the first option, follow-up courses are available
for later enrichment. Certificate programs do not have set requirements,
but many expect high school graduation or a GED certificate, obtained by
passing a high school equivalency test. Some vocational schools (e.g.,
TVI in Albuquerque) require basic skills tests. Financial aid, frequently
based on need, is available in the form of loans, grants, scholarships,
or work-study programs.

<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Option 2: Associate degree</FONT></B>

<P>With the second option, transfer to a four-year program is possible
with much of the first two years' work counting. Associate degree programs
generally require high school graduation or the GED certificate. Some,
such as the New Mexico Military Institute, require a specific number of
college preparatory courses.

<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Option 3: Bachelor's degree</FONT></B>

<P>Bachelor's degree programs require graduation or the GED certificate.
A few colleges, including St. John's College, accept students under special
circumstances who are just finishing their junior year. Required preparatory
courses vary, but most colleges require fifteen to eighteen high school
units (one unit for a full-year course): usually three units in English,
two to four in mathematics, two in science, two in social science. Out-of-state
schools often require two units in a foreign language; New Mexico schools
do not. New Mexico schools generally require the ACT, an aptitude placement
test administered by the American College Testing Service; out-of-state
schools usually require the SAT, the Scholastic Aptitude Test. In addition,
some schools require achievement tests in specialized subjects. Graduate
programs are available for students choosing third option.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Where to Get Your Education</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Your future career can be strongly affected by where you choose to get
your education. Follow
the decision-making model described in a separate chapter of this book
(<I><A HREF="CA01SELE.HTM">Selecting an Occupation</A></I>)
in selecting a school. Determine your objectives based
on the career path you hope to follow, and determine what school can best
meet these objectives. Consider all kinds of post-secondary school education:
technical-vocational schools, two-year community colleges, four-year liberal
arts colleges, universities, and service academies.

<P>To make your educational experience a positive step toward your future,
compare information from different sources: parents, teachers, guidance
counselors, alumni, friends, school catalogs (see a local public or college
library), school career resource centers, and college entrance guides.
A yearly publication entitled "Consumer Guide to Post-Secondary Education"
provides general information on all in-state (New Mexico) schools; copies
are available at high schools and post-secondary schools. Another vital
source of information is special senior programs such as Senior Days at
colleges or College Day programs where college representatives recruit
potential students. Ask all the questions necessary for you to feel comfortable
with your choice.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Selecting a Campus</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>How do you select a campus best suited to your career interests and
personality? Factors to consider in this selection are as follows:

</table>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Visit the Campus</FONT></B>

<P>Many of these factors can only be assessed by making a personal visit
to the campus. Visit while school is in session, stay overnight, include
your parents. Investigate school surroundings and atmosphere, libraries
and research facilities, departments of interest, student life, classes,
and extracurricular activities. You might contact the placement office
for names and employment data of former students in your field of interest.
Most schools will arrange for you to visit the campus, have an interview
with an admissions officer, and get a guided tour of the campus. The interviewer
may ask about your scholastic standing, courses, and extracurricular activities.
Interviews are generally not required for state-supported schools except
in special circumstances. They are often necessary for application to the
smaller private schools, though you might not have the interview at the
school (an alumni representative in your locality can conduct the interview).

<P>While colleges offer a wide variety of majors, not all colleges and
universities offer the same type of major. For example, in New Mexico,
one university offers the only architecture degree in the state. Schools
also differ as to the level of degree program offered. Astronomy at one
school may be an undergraduate program while it is a graduate program at
another school.

<P>The degree of academic competitiveness is all-important. College work
should be challenging, but it should not completely overwhelm you. With
the aid of parents, teachers, and counselors, you should make an honest
self-evaluation: How ambitious are you? How independent are you? What are
your work habits like?

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Location and Size</FONT></B>

<P>School location can be an important factor, both in terms of proximity
to home and proximity to extracurricular activities. In addition to getting
an education, you can use your college years are a time for growing up
and becoming independent; if you do go to school close to home and finances
permit, you may prefer not to live at home. Consider living in a college
dormitory.

<P>Some people prefer the sense of community and togetherness among faculty,
students, and administration that is characteristic of a small college,
and the sense of being known and of making an individual impression. Others
prefer the more varied atmosphere at a large university, where you develop
your own community. If you are friendly and outgoing, you can make friends
regardless of the campus size. Large lecture courses are rare in small
colleges and can be the norm in large universities, especially in lower-level
courses. However, in the case of large lecture courses, study groups of
about 25 students are held as often as once a week. Many students assume
that they will receive more help in a small school because the student-faculty
ratio is often smaller. Nevertheless, regardless of the size of the school,
you will only receive as much help as you seek. The advantage of a large
university is the much greater variety of courses within a given program.

<P>A women's college can give you a perspective through which to look at
women and their accomplishments; it can give you the time and opportunity
to grow, to change, and to begin to know yourself. Yet, with half of the
human race absent except on weekends, it can become a very artificial environment.

<P>Public schools are all coed and are tax supported. Because of this tax
support, tuition levels are set by state government, and expenses are lower
than at private schools. Entrance requirements are less stringent, and
competition for a place in the freshman class is not so keen.

<P>Cost may be a deciding factor. See the article <I><A HREF="CA05PAYF.HTM">Paying
for Your Education</A></I> for a discussion of how to finance your education.

<P>The liberal arts structure can leave room for you to explore different
career paths and change the goal that seemed so clear in your freshman
year. A student can arrive as a premed student and end up attending graduate
school in music and art, or vice versa. A school with a very specialized
curriculum, such as an engineering school, does not allow you to "change
horses in midstream" so easily.

<P>In selecting several schools to which you apply, be prepared to compromise;
no single school will fit your needs and desires in every respect. Keep
in mind that the school that is best for your next-door neighbor or your
brother may not be best for you. In any case, check that the schools to
which you apply are accredited and that they offer the program that fits
your interests.

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+2>Applying to Colleges:
A Timetable</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>Once you decide on several schools, submit applications. Do not make
the mistake of assuming that listing the colleges on a Pell Grant application
represents application to those schools. (Pell Grants, which were previously
known as Basic Educational Opportunity Grants, provide aid to economically
disadvantaged students.) Each school has its own application form. The
application fees are generally not refundable, so only apply if you are
sure of your choice. Apply to several schools if you are interested only
in those that are not state-supported; if you only apply to one of these
and you are not accepted, you will be left out in the cold.

Four-Year College</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Two-Year College</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>If cost is an important factor, you might consider attending a two-year
junior college and then transferring to a four-year college. The cost is
low and these are basically good schools. Plan your two-year program carefully;
it will save you grief later. Do the following:
<P>
<table border=0>
<tr><td valign=top><img src="GR_CHECK.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
Know the requirements of the four-year college you eventually plan to attend
and its transfer policies; obtain a copy of the catalog.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><img src="GR_CHECK.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
Take general liberal arts classes to meet program entry requirements: English,
history, philosophy, psychology, and sociology; such courses are easier
to transfer. If you take specialized courses in math, science, business
administration, or other subjects, you may find that they are not accepted
by the four-year school of your choice.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><img src="GR_CHECK.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
Plan your program carefully with a counselor at the two-year school. Let
her know your ultimate goal and the four-year school you plan to attend.</td></tr>
</table>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Technical-Vocational
School</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The most important question to ask in deciding if you should attend
a technical-vocational school or a college is whether you will meet your
goals. Many students assume that if they start electronics in a technical-vocational
school, it will be easy to move into electrical engineering in college.
These are two different areas and, in general, technical-vocational credits
are not transferable to colleges. Another common error is taking secretarial
training as a means of entering business administration. Again, these are
two different areas. It is important to know what it is you want to do.
If you attend a technical school you may use up your federal financial
aid (Pell Grant) and you may not receive more for a college education.
Do not misunderstand the value of state- or city-supported technical-vocational
schools: they offer excellent programs if they meet your career objectives.

<P>If you decide to attend a technical-vocational school, follow the same
procedure in selecting the school as in selecting a college. Consult with
teachers, counselors, family, and friends. Study catalogs carefully. Contact
employers who have hired graduates of the school and contact former graduates;
find out if they are satisfied with the education the school provides.
Investigate the school's reputation: contact the Better Business Bureau,
the state Department of Public Instruction, or an accrediting agency. Find
out what type of postgraduate job placement the school provides.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How a School Evaluates
You</FONT></FONT></B>

<img src="CA03_P1.JPG" width=200 alt="cap and diploma" align=right>

<P>You evaluate a school, but the school also evaluates you based on the
following:
<P>
<table border=2><tr><td>
<table border=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>

</tr></td></table>
&nbsp;<br>
Not all of these factors are taken into account by all schools. For example,
state-supported schools do not consider admission quotas, extracurricular
activities, or entrance examination scores when selecting candidates for
admission.

<P>Most colleges have certain standards that must be met. One of the first
things you should do is to make yourself familiar with these requirements
for colleges in general and for the particular colleges you are considering.
Schools with a greater degree of academic competitiveness will require
higher test scores and higher grade point averages. Most out-of-state schools
require the SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test). State-supported schools in
New Mexico usually require at least a C grade point average, high school
graduation or a GED certificate, and the ACT, an aptitude test used for
placement and advisement purposes and administered by the American College
Testing Service. At some state schools, students not meeting minimum entrance
requirements are admitted into provisional programs.

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+3>After College</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>Four basic educational options are available after college:
<OL>
<LI>
A master's degree program, Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Science (M.S.)
or Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), frequently takes one to
two years beyond the bachelor level. At some universities, these degrees
are awarded after completion of a certain amount of course work; elsewhere,
a thesis may be required.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
A doctoral degree program (Ph.D.) generally takes from two to seven years
beyond the master's, or longer, depending on the field of specialty, the
dissertation topic, and the student's rate of progress. A Ph.D. is awarded
upon completion of a dissertation and an oral examination on the subject
of the dissertation, conducted by professors and other experts in the field.
The dissertation is a paper describing original, independent research done
by the student on some subspecialty in the field. Much work, experimental
or theoretical, is needed before the dissertation is actually written.
A dissertation advisor assists in choosing a topic and gives suggestions
on how the student might proceed. Before beginning research, the student
takes a "qualifying exam" that tests for a knowledge of the fundamentals
of the field; this test can be written, oral, or a combination of both.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
A law degree (Juris Doctor or J.D.) takes three years beyond college. Before
a law graduate is licensed to practice as a lawyer, she must pass a written
test, given twice a year in New Mexico, on state and federal law (the "bar
exam") Those wishing to teach usually get further legal education, attaining
an L.L.M. (Master of Laws) or L.L.D. (Doctor of Laws) degree.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
A medical degree requires four years beyond college. The student must pass
exams covering medical subjects, given during the second and third years,
to become licensed. A few states, including New Mexico, require postgraduate
work to maintain your license. After medical school, the graduate often
does an internship and residency to become certified in a specialty; this
can take four years or more.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>
</OL>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Admissions Information</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Admission to a master's or Ph.D. program requires college graduation.
Most departments require the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE), which
tests verbal and mathematical aptitude as well as specialized knowledge
in your chosen field.

<P>Graduation from college is required for law or medical
school admission. A law school (LSAT) or medical school (MCAT) admissions
test is also required.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Scholarships</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>In the sciences, aid is usually given, without the requirement of proving
need, in the form of a scholarship or a teaching or research assistantship.

<P>Such aid pays the cost of the education and also provides a monthly
living stipend. In the nonsciences competition for the few forms of outright
assistance is very keen; most aid is in the form of a loan. In law and
medical school the education is usually paid for through part-time jobs
and loans. Some of these jobs may provide valuable experience in the chosen
field. The National Institutes of Health gives scholarship assistance to
medical students; in return, students spend their residency at a public
health facility. A small town or the military may provide aid in return
for a promise from the future doctor or lawyer to practice there.
