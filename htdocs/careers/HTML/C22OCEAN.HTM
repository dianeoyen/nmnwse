<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is an oceanographer?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>An oceanographer can be a biologist, chemist, physicist, geologist,
engineer, mathematician, computer scientist, meteorologist, or you! As
a relatively new frontier, oceanography is a wonderfully challenging and
exciting field of study providing many career opportunities. It's an important
field of study because oceans encompass 70% of the earth's surface, and
they also have an important role in understanding global weather patterns.

<P>Chemical, geological, and physical oceanographers investigate the physical
aspects of the ocean, such as salinity, currents, and the ocean floor.
Biological oceanographers study marine plants and animals and their processes
within the context of their ocean environments. Ocean engineers provide
the technology and instrumentation that allows oceanographers to explore
questions and solve problems in a variety of ways.

<P>Oceanographers are global scientists who study a wide variety of topics.
There is never a shortage of questions to answer or things to discover!
For instance, as a chemical oceanographer you might study how sea water
and sediments form, how pollutants and waste disposal impact the ocean,
or how the ocean affects climate. As a physical oceanographer you study
the ocean from a "big picture" perspective, often using satellites (remote
sensing) to understand how and where water moves, and how the ocean interacts
with the land and atmosphere to influence weather patterns. As a marine
geologist or geophysicist, you may study the formation of beaches, map
the earth's interior, or drill into the ocean's floor to discover the ocean's
history of sea-level rise and earthquakes.
Understanding these questions
helps to develop sound management policies for harvesting seafood, responding
to pollution, and recovering resources for biotechnology.
<P>The newest area
of biological oceanography is marine molecular biology. Marine biology
is the best known area of biological oceanography, and because of its
popularity, it is currently the most competitive field of oceanography
to find a job in. Oceanographic research branches into other disciplines
as well. These fields include, but are not limited to, marine resource
management, computer modeling of marine ecosystems, aquaculture, limnology
(the study of inland water systems), and mining for natural resources including
nickel, copper, manganese, petroleum, and natural gas.

<P>Because the oceans are linked to our survival on planet Earth (comfortable
climate and oxygen to breathe), oceanographers work side by side with policy
makers, social scientists, educators, and businesses to develop effective
ways of managing and maintaining our ocean resources. Our dependence on
the global ocean will increase as we look to the ocean to sustain our expanding
population's needs such as food and water. Through continued research and
new technology, we are learning how the oceans affect life and the future
of our planet.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good oceanographer?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Just as the ocean environment is incredibly diverse, so too are the
many people who study the global ocean. Oceanographers share an excitement,
curiosity, and sense of adventure in exploring planet Earth's largest environment.
An oceanographer needs patience to collect data and conduct experiments. It is really
beneficial to develop good communication skills and to work effectively
as a team member. Most major questions about the global ocean are answered
through the collaboration of many people with various specialties. In preparing
to be an oceanographer, you should be flexible and explore all your options
in this ever-growing field. Oceanographers are generally very creative
and innovative people who embrace challenging problems and address complex
issues impacting our society today and in the future.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as an oceanographer
like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Your life as an oceanographer is really variable, and you could work
in a lot of different settings. For example, you may be in a small boat
along the coastline for a day, in a laboratory setting over several days,
or on a research vessel near Antarctica for several months. You may be
on the water, in the water, under the water, or studying the areas along
the shoreline. In the laboratory oceanographers process data, perform library
research, prepare graphs and tables, and write about their results. Oceanographers
also present their research at scientific meetings and in scientific journals.

<P>Entry level oceanographers with a B.S. degree work as research or laboratory
assistants, performing routine data collection, computation, and analysis.
Most beginning oceanographers receive on-the-job training as needed. Experienced
oceanographers direct surveys and research programs or advance to administrative
or supervisory positions in research labs.

<P>Life as an oceanographer is not very routine and is definitely not a
nine-to-five job. In fact, you may spend long hours on a project or be
on a research cruise for months at a time. You must be flexible. Be encouraged
to know that all the hard work and long hours are extremely rewarding!
Being an oceanographer is a great career. It is truly exhilarating to discover
things first-hand and explore questions whose answers will benefit our
planet as a whole. As an oceanographer you may be an educator who has the
privilege of passing along to others the experiences of your career and
research.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become an oceanographer?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The minimum requirement for an oceanographer is a B.S. degree in oceanography,
biology, earth or physical sciences, mathematics, or engineering. Most
jobs require graduate training in oceanography.

<P>Prepare early! Take as many math, science, and computer classes in school
as you can. Currently, the more math classes you take the better your job
opportunities will be because you will be best prepared for a variety of
jobs. Even if you do not understand why you're taking some classes or how
they relate to your interests, take them anyway and do well.
<P>Generally,
more math means a higher salary. Your goal in high school should be to
have at least four math credits (including trigonometry, algebra, and calculus)
and four science credits (including geology, chemistry, biology, and physics).
Your college courses should include biology, meteorology, geophysics, and
some specialized science classes that apply to the study of oceans. Graduate
courses should include advanced oceanography as well as areas of special
interest for you. While all these classes might sound intimidating, they
are taken in a sequence that allows you to build on what you have already
learned.

<P>Be a volunteer and "shadow" in as many places as you can (industries,
governmental agencies, aquariums, museums, colleges, libraries). Look for
opportunities to gain hands-on experience. There are a lot of summer programs
available in the sciences. To identify programs contact the National Marine
Educators Association 408-648-4837. Be prepared for a challenge, and keep
your goal in sight even when the way seems difficult. Persevere in following
your dream. Be committed to hard work and dedication. Don't give up; you
will succeed, and you will be greatly rewarded!

<P>Oceanographers are employed by industry, the federal government, and
in academia. As with any field, the career opportunities available will
depend on market demand and competition.
<P>Currently, the greatest demand
in oceanography is for chemical and physical oceanographers and ocean engineers.
The future looks bright in the fields of remote sensing, mathematical modeling,
computer programming, aquaculture, biotechnology, engineering, and public
policy. Salaries depend largely on your training and area of specialization.
Be realistic! Stay current on the job market through your college and advertisements
in science periodicals, join professional organizations, and access electronic
bulletins. If you are committed to exploring a career in oceanography,
you should pursue it aggressively and know that the ocean sciences are
available to all!
