<P>So, the time has come for you to "get a career," but where do you start?
Well, you'll find most of the information right inside yourself. Start
by assessing your values, interests, skills and personality characteristics.
Here are a few questions to get the ball rolling:
<br>&nbsp;
<table border=0>
<tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
What important decisions have you made, and what values were inherent in
those decisions?
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
Think about the times when you have been angry, frustrated, overjoyed,
or ecstatic. What were the underlying values present in those situations?
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
What hobbies do you have, and what do you like about them?
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
What are/were your favorite and least favorite high school subjects and why?
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
What adjectives describe you? How would others describe you?
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
How do you define success?
</td></tr></table>
&nbsp;<br>
Next, allow yourself to dream. What might a day in your life look like
ten years from now? If you could clone yourself into five
people, what different occupations would each of the five do? What
is similar about all five? What's different?

<P>After you have a pretty good idea of who you are and what characteristics
you wish to display in the world of work, it's time to get information
about what's out there. How do you do this research? There are several
ways. One is to go to the public library or to a career resource center
(colleges and universities usually have them) and see what information
they have on your desired occupations. You can also check the Internet
or write to the professional/trade association (find where to write in
the Encyclopedia of Associations in the reference section of a library).
Some high schools, colleges, and universities may also have a computer
guidance system to help you. But really, the best source of information
about any occupation comes from the people who are currently doing the
job. Find out who they are and request a short (twenty-minute) interview
with three or four people who work in different settings. Maybe they would
let you follow them around for a few hours or even for a whole day to experience
what life on the job is really like.

<P>Here's an example. Let's say I'm interested in engineering, but I'm
not sure what area specifically. My mom has a friend that's an electrical
engineer at Intel, our neighbor is a chemical engineer at Los Alamos National
Laboratories, and my brother's friend is a civil engineer for the highway
department. I arrange to interview each of these three people and they
even let me follow them around (job shadow) for a few hours. After these
experiences, I have a much better idea of what tasks and environments are
involved with these types of jobs. Of course, I would also take the opportunity
to get advice on how I should proceed with my career from these experts.
(Don't forget to send a thank you card or letter for their time!) I may
have found that none of these areas are for me, so it's back to the library
to research some other areas.

<P>It is important to remember that you are a woman of many talents, and
there are many ways you can display these talents in the world of work.
What may be an ideal job now may be boring in five years. What is only
a hobby now may become your primary source of income in the future. A career
is a succession of vocations and avocations (e.g., hobbies) over a lifetime.
You have one career which may be made up of many different jobs in different
fields. The best thing to do is to continue exploring occupations of interest
and occasionally reassess your values, interests, skills and personality
characteristics to see which talents you wish to display in the world of
work at any given time. Explore! Explore! Explore!

<P>Now that you've assessed your values, interests, skills and personality
characteristics, weave it all together into a "job wanted" ad as if it
were to appear in the classified advertisements. Use the following outline
to help you:
<br>&nbsp;
<table border=0>
<tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
The functions I would perform are (skills and abilities):
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="PENCIL.GIF"></td><td valign=top>
The organization I work for will share my following goals (values):

The environment I work in would use one or more of the following special
knowledge or interest areas (interests/special knowledge areas):

Other areas I want my ideal job to include:

Next, target your resume for your ideal job.
