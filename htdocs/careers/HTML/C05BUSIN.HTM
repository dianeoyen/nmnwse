<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is a business manager?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>A business manager directs or plans the work of others in order to run
a business at a profit. She should have a working knowledge of the following
areas, and may be a specialist in one or more: sales, marketing, and public
relations; research, operations analysis, data processing, mathematics,
statistics, and economics; production; finance; accounting, auditing, tax,
and budgeting; purchasing; and personnel. Other technical areas in which
a business manager may have expertise are law, science, or engineering.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes a good business
manager?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The business manager needs to be a self-starter, needs to be observant
and persistent, and needs to be able to work well with other people. She
needs decision-making skills, assertiveness, fairness, and an interest
in business. She should be able to communicate her ideas to others in a
clear and accurate manner, both orally and in writing.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as a
business manager like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Business managers direct workers in sales, research, production, accounting,
and purchasing. A business manager may own her own business, or she may
work as part of a management team in a business owned by others. In larger
businesses, she may spend most of her time planning, supervising, and measuring
results of operations. In smaller businesses, she may do all of this and
take part in some of the operations herself. There is usually no set working
schedule; she invests the time required to get the job done.

<P>With the exception of sales and production, college degrees are preferred
or required for all business management positions. A college degree is
an asset for sales and production as well, although a high school degree
and on-the-job training may be acceptable in many companies. Many business
owners do not have college degrees, relying on their own experience and
using qualified staff and outside professionals for areas in which they
have no expertise, or no time.

<P>
In high school you should take college-preparatory
courses, particularly those which develop speaking and writing skills.
Take courses in the social sciences, such as history and economics. Courses
in math and the natural sciences will develop your analytic skills.

<P>Undergraduate degrees are offered in most of the specialties named in
the section describing what a business manager is. Either a business or
management degree will offer some coverage of each of the specialties.
A liberal arts degree prepares one for analytic thinking, discussion, and
writing and may be acceptable to businesses that have their own training
programs for managers. The graduate program that offers the best training
for management is the Master of Business Administration (MBA). For the
future business manager who intends to specialize in mathematics, economics,
or engineering, graduate work is often a requirement; it is definitely
a requirement for specialization in corporate law.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>In New Mexico, there will be a growing need for business specialists
and managers, especially in sales, accounting, purchasing, and personnel.
Nationwide, the fastest-growing specialties in business are the technical
ones that require math and computer skills. Business managers are one of
the fastest growing occupation groups in the country.
