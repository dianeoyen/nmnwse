One of the best things you can do for yourself is to establish a mentor/prot&eacute;g&eacute;
relationship with someone who is pursuing the career in which you are interested.
Briefly, a mentor is someone who
<br>&nbsp;

offers the wisdom of her experience,</td></tr>

acts as a role model.</td></tr>

</td></tr></table>
&nbsp;<br>
You, of course, are the prot&eacute;g&eacute;. A mentor can be any age,
either sex, and can be as close as your school building or as far away
as your computer or "snail mail" can reach. You will have many mentors
in your life. As a mid-school student, you can look for mentors at your
school (your teachers), local high schools (teachers and students) or at
the college level (generally college students who are majors in the field
in which you want to major). A high school student can look to her teachers,
college students or faculty, or people who are working in her field of
interest.

<P>Your job as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; is to be open to the knowledge,
experience, and resources that your mentor can give you. Share your goals
and objectives with your mentor. Your should receive realistic feedback
and grow and build on that feedback. However, you are not a clone or copy
of your mentor. While you will learn from and benefit from the mentor/prot&eacute;g&eacute;
relationship, you will maintain your uniqueness as an individual.

<P>How do you find a mentor? The best sources are often the closest - your
parents and teachers. Professional organizations (like the New Mexico Network
for Women in Science &amp; Engineering) are another good resource. You
can contact the university you would like to attend. Use the telephone
book to find companies who are doing the type of work you would like to
do. If you have access to a computer (if you don't, you should try your
local public library) browse the Web. When you find a contact you want
to make, your letter or E-mail should include the following:
