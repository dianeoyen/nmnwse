<P>A cover letter should accompany your resume and be addressed to the
person doing the hiring. Usually, cover letters consist of four paragraphs.
The first paragraph is interest-generating. Use the name of a personal
contact that referred you to the position or your knowledge about the company
to catch the eye of the reader. The first paragraph also states or implies
interest in employment with the company or organization.

<P>The second and third paragraphs are interchangeable. One gives a background
summary of your experience and education and the other is a "value-selling"
paragraph highlighting your key strengths, skills and abilities and describing
how they will benefit the employer.

<P>The last paragraph compels follow-up action. State that you will call
the employer on a specified date to follow-up on your resume or to arrange
for an interview. Of course, if you say you're going to do it, you have
to do it!

<P>You may close the letter with a statement of appreciation such as "Thank
you for considering my application, and I look forward to meeting you."

<P>Place your cover letter and resume in a nicely addressed envelope, stamp
it, and send it off!
