scientist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>An environmental scientist works to prevent contamination of the environment.
In some cases this means keeping contamination from reaching the environment
in the first place, and in other cases it means cleaning up contamination
that has been released to the environment. Just about every industry in
the world creates waste products. Before there were laws and regulations
governing the disposal of these waste products, the waste was disposed
of in the environment - on land, in surface water, or in groundwater. In
these old disposal areas, the waste products that could pose a risk to
humans or to the plants and animals in the environment must be cleaned
up. With the establishment of laws and regulations governing where waste
products can be disposed of, most industries use environmental scientists
to find ways to minimize and recycle the waste they produce.

scientist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Good environmental scientists have a desire to clean the environment
so that it is safe for people, animals, and plants to live in. In order
to do this, environmental scientists must have a good understanding of
one or more of the many branches of science (e.g., hydrology, chemistry,
biology, toxicology, and engineering) that must be applied to the problems
of cleaning up contaminants in the environment or preventing them from
entering the environment. Because one person cannot be an expert in all
of the sciences, a good environmental scientist must be able to work well
in teams made of people with different backgrounds. They must also be able
to communicate well, both in large and small groups and in written form.

<P>Environmental scientists must enjoy working outdoors. Often this type
of work requires collecting samples from the environment to test them for
contamination. Depending on the specialty of the environmental scientist,
she may have to collect samples (or observe or map) the soil, water, vegetation,
or animals. Once the samples have been collected and the testing is done,
the environmental scientist must analyze the information to decide how
best to clean up the site. This analysis generally involves using computers
to model or predict where the contamination will go.

<P>Finally, a good environmental scientist must be able to understand the
environmental laws and regulations, particularly how they apply to the
specific problem that is being worked on.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is life as an environmental
scientist like?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Environmental scientists generally have a good balance between outdoor
work and office work. There is a great deal of satisfaction in collecting
data and then analyzing it to develop conclusions based on scientific principles.
This is particularly true when working in a team, where all the team members
contribute ideas and perspectives from their own experiences. This can be
a very intellectually stimulating environment. The greatest feeling for
an environmental scientist is finishing the cleanup of a contaminated site,
knowing it is safe for people and the environment.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>How do I become an environmental
scientist?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Environmental scientists come from a broad range of educational backgrounds
because it takes people from many scientific disciplines to figure out
how to clean up a contaminated area. To become an environmental scientist,
you should take as many math, science, and communication classes in high school
as possible. Important areas to study are chemistry, physics, biology,
trigonometry, algebra, and calculus. In college, your undergraduate education
should be broad and include some courses in many different sciences including
geology, geography, computer science, engineering, technical writing, statistics,
calculus, biological sciences, chemistry, and physics. A graduate degree
is strongly recommended for environmental scientists, and during graduate
studies is the time to choose a discipline to specialize in.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>What/where are the jobs?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Environmental scientists work in both the private and public sectors.
In the private sector there are consulting firms that contract with both
industry and government to conduct environmental investigations and cleanup.
Some private firms specialize in areas such as the cleanup of leaking underground
storage tanks or cleaning up groundwater that is contaminated. In the public
sector, there are jobs as regulators with cities (Albuquerque Environmental
Health Department, the State (New Mexico Environment Department), or the
Federal government (Environmental Protection Agency). The regulators watch
over industry and contractors to make sure all their work is in compliance
with laws and regulations. Other federal agencies, such as the Department
of Energy or Department of Defense hire environmental scientists to mange
the cleanup of contamination on their property.
