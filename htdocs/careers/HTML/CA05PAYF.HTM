<P>Numerous financial assistance programs are available to help you meet
educational expenses. Most fall into two major categories: "gifts" or grants
and self-help programs. Gifts, grants, and scholarships are financial aid
for which you will probably not incur any indebtedness or future obligation.
Self-help is aid you either earn while you are in school, as in the case
of a college work-study program, or repay when your education is completed,
as with a student loan. (For most federal loans, you have a six-month "grace
period" after your education is complete before interest begins to accrue
and payments begin.)

<P>Organizations that make these funds available include federal and state
governments, private industry, the military, and social or service organizations
at the community level. Eligibility for funding is usually determined on
the basis of your financial need and/or your academic merit for an award.
Other requirements can be considered and may be the determining factor
in programs sponsored by private industry or social organizations. You
need to contact any private donor directly to find out specifics of eligibility.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Financial Aid</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The aid most readily available at post-secondary institutions in New
Mexico is federal and state undergraduate grants, low-interest loans, and
work-study programs. To be eligible, you must (1) apply for the type of
assistance you desire, and (2) qualify for the assistance you requested.
You may also have to satisfy a citizenship requirement; for example, if
you are on a student visa or an exchange visitor visa, you cannot get federal
student aid.

<P>All New Mexico public post-secondary institutions use the Free Application
for Federal Student Aid for federal and state programs. The private institutions
may also require additional family asset information to determine your
eligibility for federal and state programs. The resulting Student Aid Report
provides each institution with the financial information necessary to determine
your eligibility. If you are under the age of 24, the federal government
considers you a dependent and will require parental information to determine
your eligibility. However, consideration for independent status can be
requested at each institution. Scholarship applications are different for
each institution and should be requested early in the year to ensure proper
consideration. Deadlines for scholarships are usually between February
1 and April 1.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Need Analysis</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The end result of the information you supply is a need analysis. The
need analysis compares the costs of attending a given institution with
your ability to meet those costs. If the costs to attend are higher than
the amount that you and/or your family can afford, you are eligible for
the difference in financial aid. For example, you are recommended for a
larger award if you apply to a more expensive school since the dollar amount
that you and/or your parents can contribute to your education is the same
no matter how expensive the school.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Planning Early</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>It is important to begin planning early. The preference deadline for
financial aid applications from entering students is March 1 of each academic
year for New Mexico schools. If you plan to enter a college, university,
or other post-secondary institution in August, submit your financial aid
application in February to receive maximum consideration for funding. If
you wish to attend a school out of state, contact that school for information
concerning application and eligibility requirements. In any case, an aid
application should be made when you apply to a school, not after you are
accepted. Furthermore, you must reapply for most forms of aid every year,
and if you transfer to another school, your aid does not automatically
follow.

<P>After your application is reviewed, you will receive an award letter
detailing the types and amounts of assistance for which you are eligible.
Financial assistance will often be in the form of a "package" that includes
several types of aid. Read the award letter carefully, and follow any instructions
accompanying it. Evaluate how the types and amounts of aid will meet your
specific needs. Pay particular attention to the amount of "self-help" assistance
you have been offered, since you will need to work for this money while
you are in school and/or repay the funds once you have left. If you apply
for financial aid at more than one school and have an offer from each,
take an advance look at how much it will actually cost to attend each school.
Make your decision based upon such factors as tuition cost, living expenses
either on or off campus, books and supplies, personal expenses, and transportation
expenses to and from campus. Not all applicants will be eligible for need-based
assistance. If you apply for this type of aid but do not qualify, you should
be notified in writing. Notification usually includes information about
alternative types of aid, such as a student loan at a slightly higher interest
rate from the state or a private lender.

<P>Financing your education as a graduate student can be more difficult
unless you are a potential scientist or engineer. Application for aid should
be made through both the graduate department to which you apply and through
the financial aid office. In the sciences, aid in the form of a scholarship
or a teaching or research assistantship is usually given, without the requirement
of proving need. Such aid pays the cost of tuition and provides a monthly
living stipend as well. In the nonsciences, you may still be eligible for
federal or state loans and work-study programs, but grant assistance, except
from the institution or a private source, usually ends with the bachelor's
degree. However, a rural community or the military may provide assistance
to the future doctor or lawyer in exchange for the promise to locate in
the military or a rural area after completion of schooling.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Where do I get more information?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Each year the New Mexico Association of Financial Aid Administrators
publishes a consumer guide to aid programs available throughout the state,
as well as those specific to each institution.<a href="#ref1">&sup1;</a>&nbsp; The U.S. Government
Printing Office publishes a guide to six federal aid programs.<a href="#ref2">&sup2;</a>&nbsp;
All types of aid programs are outlined in both pamphlets. The free state
pamphlet is available from the financial aid offices of state institutions
and includes information about student costs, interest rates, and repayment
schedules for loans. Other sources of information include your high school
counselor, various educational service centers such as the Division of
Vocational Rehabilitation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the League of
United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the Social Security and Veterans
Administrations (for those eligible), and private funding sources available
on the Internet. You need to set up an interview with a financial aid advisor
to help plan how you will meet your educational expenses. Through a personal
contact of this type, a long-range plan for reaching your degree objective
can be outlined.
