<h3>What is a veterinarian?</h3>

</p><p>A veterinarian is a surgeon, a dentist, a radiologist, an internist,
an ophthalmologist, a neurologist, and a pathologist for cats, dogs, sheep,
pigs, horses, cattle, goats, birds, fish, rabbits, gerbils, hamsters, etc.
Most veterinarians do not specialize beyond working on small or large animals.
A specialty in the various fields mentioned is possible, but only in universities
or very large practices in large cities.

</p>
<hr>
<h3>What makes a good veterinarian?</h3>

<p>A good veterinarian is skillful with her hands, enjoys solving problems,
is confident in handling animals, and has a broad knowledge of medicine
and surgery. These skills can be learned, but they are of little value
if the veterinarian cannot communicate with people. Being able to interact
with people is actually much more important than being able to interact
with animals; the most skillful veterinarian will probably sit idle if
she does not enjoy people.


</p>
<hr>
<h3>What is life as a veterinarian
like?</h3>

<p><img src="@2x/clipart/C31_P2.JPG" class="right" width="250" style="padding:15px;">Life as a veterinarian is rewarding, frustrating, and time consuming,
but it is never boring. A major portion of the work itself is routine;
nevertheless, no two animals and no two owners are alike, so each case
is a new challenge. Only a very small portion of the work involves gloriously
saving lives or performing miraculous surgery. A lot of time is spent at
the south end of a north-facing animal. A typical day might include performing
surgery; seeing animals with health problems; giving inoculations; going
out on calls in the country; working at a racetrack; working in a zoo;
establishing a herd health program for a feedlot, dairy farm, or large
poultry operation; inspecting meat at a slaughterhouse; or doing research
for a drug company. In the evening you might be called back to the office
to deal with an emergency that often turns out to be an animal that has
been sick for two weeks. The call usually comes just as you sit down to
eat or just as you go to bed. After you have helped an animal that truly
needs your help, however, it seems worth the trouble.

</p>
<hr>
<h3>How do I become a veterinarian?</h3>

<p>To receive a doctor of veterinary medicine (D.V.M. or V.M.D.) degree
requires a minimum of three years in college plus four years in veterinary
school. Most people are not accepted in veterinary school, however, without
completing four years of college. To obtain a license you must pass written
and oral examinations.

</p><p>In high school, a college preparatory curriculum that includes math
and science is good preparation for the courses you need in college. Any
courses that help develop skills in dealing with people are beneficial.

</p><p>Most pre-veterinary curricula include biology, math, physics, chemistry,
English, and some sociology courses. In addition to taking your college
courses, it is important to gain practical knowledge by working for a veterinarian.
Too many students applying to veterinary schools have romantic ideas about
being a veterinarian; therefore, veterinary schools are looking for people
who know what they are getting into.



</p>
<p>In most veterinary schools, you do not have a choice of classes. You
will take anatomy, physiology, microbiology, pathology, medicine, surgery,
pharmacology, and nutrition. During the last two years you work mainly
in the clinic gaining practical knowledge.

</p>
<hr>
<h3>What/where are the jobs?</h3>

<p><img src="@2x/clipart/C31_P3.JPG" class="right" width="250" style="padding:15px;">Because of the opening of several new veterinary schools and the increase
in class size at some established schools, new veterinarians may face competition
in establishing practices in some areas. Nevertheless, employment is expected
to grow faster than the average for all occupations, primarily because
of growth in the pet population. Growth in public health and disease-control
programs and an increased reliance upon scientific methods of raising and
breeding poultry and livestock will also contribute to the demand for veterinarians.
While an oversupply of veterinarians seems imminent in some locations,
veterinarians will probably always be needed in remote rural areas; however,
making a living is also harder in these areas.

</p>
<p>The majority of veterinarians are in private practice. About seven percent
are employed by the federal government, chiefly in the Department of Agriculture
and the Public Health Service, with a small number serving as commissioned
officers in the veterinary services of the Army and Air Force. Other employers
are state and local government agencies, schools of veterinary medicine,
research and development laboratories, large livestock farms, and pharmaceutical
companies that manufacture drugs.
