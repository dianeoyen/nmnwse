   <P>Membership in the network helps to support all of the efforts
   of the group. Members attend chapter meetings, receive the printed
   version of <A HREF="News.html">The Network News</A>, sponsor and
   participate in Expanding Your Horizons Conferences or other
   outreach and chapter activities, and have the opportunity to
   attend and make technical presentations at the annual meeting.
   </p><p>
   Members also receive an electronic copy of the current NMNWSE roster, which contains the contact information for all members to facillitate networking. 
   </p><p>

   now $40.00 per year for regular members, and the reduced rate for students, teachers, retired members, and non-employed members is $10.00.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br><i>Notes from the NMNWSE webmaster (updated 2/2016):</i>
<br><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_dot.gif" height=10>&nbsp;The posted membership forms have been updated to reflect the new NMNWSE mailing address.
<br><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_dot.gif" height=10>&nbsp;The posted membership forms have been updated to the 2015 versions.
<br><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_dot.gif" height=10>&nbsp;The posted html membership form is not a web form which can be filled in online I hope to get it updated to a web form eventually.
<br><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_dot.gif" height=10>&nbsp;Note the pdf version is now a pdf form - please <a href="mailto:webmaster@nmnwse.org">contact the webmaster</a> if you encounter problems with the form. 
<br><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_dot.gif" height=10>&nbsp;Problems with the pdf form are often resolved by saving the form to your desktop, filling it in making sure to use an Adobe product to open, saving, then emailing as an attachment to the <a href="mailto:webmaster@nmnwse.org">webmaster</a>. 
<br><img src="http://nmnwse.org/Images/bl_dot.gif" height=10>&nbsp;If all else fails, you can simply print, fill in by hand, then scan and email or mail a hardcopy.
<P>
For other questions about membership, please <a href="mailto:NMNWSE_Board-L@list.unm.edu">contact the board</a>.
