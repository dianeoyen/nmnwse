<P>
LAWIS is proud to sponsor awards at local area Science Fairs.
The purpose of the awards is
<CENTER><I><B>
&quot;to promote gender equity and to encourage female students<br>
to continue their studies in math, science, and engineering.&quot;
</B></I></CENTER>
These &quot;Northern Chapter&quot; awards compliment the awards given out by the NMNWSE
at the state Science Fair.

<P>
<! Again this year we have branched out and gave out awards at more than 1 Science Fair. >
If you would like to help judge or if you want to organize "Northern
