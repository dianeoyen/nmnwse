<p><b>SUBJECT: Follow-up to Concerns Regarding Sexual Harassment Investigations
at the Laboratory</b>
<p>Dear Kathy:
<p>Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with Tom Locke and
me concerning sexual harassment investigations at the Laboratory. Reviewing
the material you provided, including the anonymous reports of different
women who have experienced sexual harassment, it is quite clear that your
suggestion for better communication to the work force is most appropriate.
We will work on a revision to the Staff Relations web page that provides
employees with the type of information you suggest. However, as a practical
matter, this will take a fair amount of time. In the interim, I hope it
will prove helpful for me to answer some basic questions through this letter
.
<p><u>Does the Laboratory take allegations of sexual harassment seriously
and does it take action to protect someone bringing allegations forward?</u>
<p>In the two years that I have been at the Laboratory, three managers
have been terminated from employment for engaging in inappropriate sexual
conduct. There have also been suspensions and lesser disciplinary actions
when less serious conduct was involved. Without a doubt, the Laboratory
takes these matters very seriously.
<p>It has also been my experience at the Laboratory that management makes
substantial efforts to ensure that those who bring forth information about
sexual harassment do not encounter retaliation. Staff Relations works closely
with line management to see that those who report sexual harassment, or
any other misconduct, suffer no adverse employment actions. We have, I
believe, a perfect record in this regard during my tenure at LANL. However,
we have been less successful controlling day-to-day work interactions that
may make a harassment victim uncomfortable. Nevertheless, I believe our
record has improved substantially in this regard over the last couple of
years.
<p><u>Where can an employee go if they are suffering harassment and can
the employee count on confidentiality if she or he does not want to file
a formal complaint?</u>
<p>An employee can go to a number of places to discuss problems of sexual
harassment. These include Staff Relations, which is the group that investigates
such allegations, the Human Resources Generalist in the employee's division,
group or division level management, the OMBUDS office, and the Office of
Equal Opportunity. However, the only place where an employee can discuss
sexual harassment that she or he has encountered with confidence that confidentiality
will be absolutely respected, subject only to legal requirements for disclosure,
is ESH-2, which includes the Medical Department and the Employee Assistance
Program. The OMBUDS office maintains a confidential telephone information
service for general questions and will honor an employee's request to keep
information about sexual harassment confidential to the extent possible.
However, the ability of OMBUDS to maintain such confidentiality is more
limited in these situations than the ability possessed by ESH-2. It is
important to note that neither ESH-2 nor Ombuds can take any formal action
to investigate harassment. For that to occur, the victim must report the
harassment to her (or his) line management or HR.
<p><u>If there is going to be a sexual harassment investigation by Staff
Relations, what can I expect?</u>
<p>Staff Relations is the organization at the Laboratory that investigates
concerns of harassment. Staff Relations must remain neutral while gathering
and assessing the facts. Understandably, there is the potential for an
employee who believes he/she has been harassed to feel the process is less
than supportive. For this reason, many employees choose to bring a friend,
relative, or peer with them as moral support. Employees are welcome to
do this, provided the friend, relative or peer is also a LANL employee.
Some employees choose to bring a formal representative from a labor organization
that has filed with the California Public Employment Relations Board in
order to represent LANL employees. Such representatives do not have to
be LANL employees. Also, if the friend, relative, peer, or representative
will also be a witness, the Staff Relations Specialist may need to interview
the employee making the allegations without that person present.
<p>In many cases, people interviewed are instructed to refrain from discussing
the case with others while it is being investigated and are asked to sign
a document confirming the instruction. While this may be upsetting to someone
bringing forth the concerns, it is sometimes necessary in order to ensure
an effective investigation. However, the instructions explicitly allow
a person to discuss the matter with a spouse or domestic partner, personal
advisors such as an attorney, physician or mental health provider, the
Ombuds office, .the Employee Assistance Program staff, and Laboratory staff
attorneys. In addition, if someone wants to discuss the matter with others,
they simply need to explain this to the Staff Relations Specialist. If
there is a way of accommodating the request without compromising the investigation,
we will do so.
<p>After speaking with the person filing the complaint, the Staff Relations
Specialist will interview and collect facts from the accused and other
people who may have knowledge of the facts on which the allegation is based.
While the person filing the complaint will be asked about other witnesses,
it is ultimately the sole responsibility of the Staff Relations Specialist
to determine who will be interviewed and what they will be asked.
<p>Sexual harassment investigations frequently involve events or actions
where only the employee making the allegations and the accused were present.
To conduct a thorough investigation, the Staff Relations Specialist ultimately
must make a determination as to the credibility of the employee making
the allegations and the credibility of the accused. Therefore, the Specialist
may need to call each party back for additional interviews to explore new
facts or allegations that come out during the investigation. Each person
with relevant information to add to the investigation will be asked to
sign a statement. Typically, an initial draft is prepared by the Staff
Relations Specialist. However, each person has the opportunity to edit
the document prior to signing it.
<p>Once the investigation is complete, the Staff Relations Specialist prepares
a report for the Division Leader of the person who was accused of harassment.
The report includes a determination of whether misconduct occurred and,
if so, a recommendation about what corrective/disciplinary action the managers
should take. In the event Staff Relations and the Division Leader are unable
to agree on the appropriate response, the matter is elevated through the
management chain of the Laboratory .In my experience at LANL, such elevation
of issues has never been necessary .
<p>We are aware that this process is exceedingly stressful and sometimes
unpleasant. The person bringing forth the concern must answer some very
personal questions, including questions about any sexual activity that
took place between him- or herself and the accused. As a result, we strongly
recommend that the employee making the allegations consult with EAP for
assistance in dealing with the stress of the investigation. Part of the
stress occurs because the employee cannot control the investigation. That
means that once the harassment is reported, the employee may be unable
to change her or his mind and stop the process. The more serious the allegation,
the less likely it is that the employee will be able to maintain control
over the course of events. We wish this were not the case, but the state
of sexual harassment law requires LANL to investigate serious allegations
of harassment even if the employee making the allegations would rather
stop the investigation. To do otherwise could increase the risk to other
employees.
<p>Once action against a perpetrator has been decided upon and implemented,
Staff Relations and the employee's management will provide as much information
as we can to the person who brought the complaint -but that is a limited
amount. The California Information Practices Act provides privacy rights
to individuals, so it is not appropriate to tell a victim, for example,
that the perpetrator has been terminated. After a particular case in which
our failure to communicate with the victim caused her to undergo more harassment,
we improved our procedures in this area substantially. Our intent is to
provide as much information as we can, consistent with the law. In the
event an accused individual is issued instructions about how to deal in
the future with the person who complained, such instructions will be reduced
to writing and a copy provided to individuals affected.
<p>Kathy, I truly hope this letter helps people understand the procedures
they will encounter if they file a harassment complaint with Staff Relations.
I am very concerned about the prospect that employees victimized by others
might refrain from coming forward because of concerns about this process.
If you encounter individuals who do not want to report harassment they
have been experiencing, please urge them to go to the Employee Assistance
Program. In that venue, they may speak with assurances of confidentiality
and the counselors in EAP are first- rate professionals.
