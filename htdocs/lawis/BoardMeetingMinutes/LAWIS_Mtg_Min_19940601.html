MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF June 1, 1994

Members of the steering committee met in Room E228 of the Otowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Denise George
    Shirley Herrera
    Jo Irwin (formerly Skrivan)
    Karen Schultz Paige
    Trish Wright

Three topics were discussed at the meeting. Jo asked if anyone knew what
was happening with the Women's Committee now that is disbanded. She
also wanted to know what was going on with the meeting in Albuquerque
regarding the status of women in the DOE complexes. She agreed to contact
Wendee Brunish in order to find out more information about these matters.

Shirley has provided the Steering Committee with an up-to-date list of
addresses for the membership from the main lab computer. This information 
will be used to correct our data base. It will also be used to mail
out our announcements from now on. Denise George agreed to get together
with Lois and use the information in our database to produce a membership
booklet. They will try to get this booklet finished in time to hand it out
at the upcoming luncheon on networking skills for women.

Karen presented information on the networking luncheon being organized
for the membership. It will be on June 21 in Side Room B. A buffet lunch of
Southwest chicken will be served at 11:30. Our speaker will be Rita Martinez-
Purson from Santa Fe Community College. She will speak from 12 - 1 on the
subject of networking and communication skills for technical women. She
will also mention issues concerning gender. The talk will include lecture
and facilitated exercises. The cost will be $7.50 for members (subsidized 2$
by LAWIS) and $9.50 for non-members (at cost). We agreed to accommodate
people who don't want lunch with chairs in the back of the room. We
decided to give Rita a $100 honorarium for her time. Trish Wright is
responsible for making and mailing the flyers announcing the luncheon.
Deborah Kubicek will handle the money and tickets. RSVPs for the lunch are
due by June 11. A final head count for the lunch must be given to the 
cafeteria by Monday June 20.

The next Steering Committee Meeting will be June 29. Karen will make
arrangements and send out announcements.
