Next Meeting Dec. 14 at noon.

Finance Report:

An EYH bank account has been set up and it has the $300 from the State 
Network.  At the next State Board Meeting, Dec. 17, the Northern Chapter 
budget will be presented and we will ask for the $200 that we did not 
receive for last year.  Last year's budget was gone over and it was 
determined that this year's budget will be the same except for the gift.  
dede said she would take care of preparing the budget for this year and 
present it at the next meeting.  She will also see that it is presented to 
the State Board on Dec. 17.

The donators from last year were gone over and members volunteered to visit 
their respective places of business.  Wendee volunteered to contact LANB, 
Mountain Community Bank, and R-Books.  Shirley will check with her group, 
CIC-13, for a program code, McDonalds, Baskin Robbins, and the new cafeteria 
management.  Alexine will contact UNM and Valencia Moters.  Karen will 
contact ACS.  Lynda will contact the Credit Union and ask her group leader 
for a program code.

Awards:

Alexine contacted the New Mexico Industries for the Blind.  She brought 
examples of several tote bags with a price list.  It was decided to get 180 
of the plain book bags in natural with turquoise trim and 2 color logo.  At 
$3.41 each this will be $613.  The budget should reflect the new cost 
because this is $200 cheaper that the t-shirts.  Alexine will go ahead and 
order them so that we get a 5% discount.  They will deliver them.  Wendee 
will contact her artist friend to see if she will do a design for us.  

It was decided that we would give the t-shirts from last years away in the 
drawings.

Registration:

Carol volunteered to do the registration form since she is doing the 
registration.

Packets:

Everyone will contact their organizaitons to see if they can get brochures 
to put out on the table for the girls to browse and take.

Facilities:

The Study Center is reserved.  Renita will call and reserve the University 
House rooms, Otowi P180, P280, E128, E228, the Moon Room, the CNLS 
Conference room, Physics Auditorium, and the HRL Auditorium.

Presentors:

Karen asked for help finding presentors.  Everyone should see if they can't 
find people for her.  It was decided that this was a little early to be able 
to lock people in.  Denise has a list she will give Karen.

Program:

It was decided to go with the egg drop with teams of no more than 6 girls as 
the morning conference activites with all the girls.  Lynda will ask 
Kathleen Ramsey to do the afternoon program. 

Adult Program:

Carol Mooney can give a 20-25 minute talk for the adults.  She will have 
brochures.  Wendee will contact her for more information.
