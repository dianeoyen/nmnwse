MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF January 18, 1995

Members of the steering committee met in Side Room C of the Otowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Denise George
    Shirley Herrera
    Jo Irwin
    Deborah Kubicek
    Susan Roach
    Karen Schultz Paige
    Lynda Towers
    Wendee Brunish

Replacing Loyda Martinez
    Loyda Martinez was called about not attending any of the board meetings. 
    She requested that she be replaced. Wendee Brunish volunteered to take
    Loyda's place. 

February Women's Issues Talk (Susan)
    Setting up a talk for sometime around Valentine's day. Will try to get 
    either Alicia Lauritzen or Lois Toevs to talk. Susan will take care of 
    details, send out fliers, and order the lunches. Susan needs a set of 
    mailing labels from Denise.

Local Science Fair
    To be held at Pueblo Complex Fri. Feb 10th and Sat the 11th. Jo, Deborah,
    and Wendee volunteered to go over after work on Friday to judge the 
    entries for WIS awards. Last years awards were one free tuition to the
    Childrens College and several $10 certificates. Denise suggested dropping 
    the tuition (too complicated etc) and giving out just gift certificates. 
    The board voted and approved a $100 budget for these certificates.
    Denise will handle getting the certificates and contacting the necessary 
    people.

Position Reports:
    Treasurer
        Trish not present but send handouts of a preliminary budget. Deborah 
        asked everyone to begin filling this out for areas people were 
        familiar with. We will try to work on this at the next meeting.
        FY94 report handed out also. Not sure what to do with these other than
        use them to help fill out budget for next year.
    Membership
        Denise will be sending out delinquency notices to those members 
        whom have not paid their dues yet. Creation of the membership booklet 
        will have to wait until after EYH.
    Newsletter
        The next newsletter will be coming out around the end of March. 
    EYH
        Coming along nicely.
    NMNWSE Liaison
        A check for $200 was received for last years EYH funds. It was decided 
        that the liaison will NOT handle (for this year) getting our new
        membership applications and dues to the network. Denise will give
        applications directly to Lynda (the Network's membership person).
        Trish still needs to know how and when to get dues to the Network.

Jo discussed the UNM-LA Mentoring program. She will look into it further to
    see how the Women in Science can fit into this program. What is known so 
    far is that UNM has been given grant money to carry out the program and 
    that the women in it are taking a special "professional development" course.
    Jo says it looks a lot like the Re-entry program.

"Who We Are" brochures
    Deborah will look into finding out the cost of producing these locally at
    Alphagraphics to compare to what dede pays. It was decided that we should 
    be placing these in places around town. Shirley will find out if it is
    possible to have these put in new hire packages at the Laboratory.
    It was decided to insert an application (sent to Norther Chapter) and also
    an insert that briefly states our mission, annual events, and board members.
    Susan will sent Deborah a floppy containing the mission statement sheet.

Scholarship Account/Funds 
    It was voted on and approved to get rid of the scholarship account and
    place the funds from that account into the regular checking account. The
    account was originally set up for the Re-entry program, which no longer
    exists. Any scholarships like funds have been coming out of the regular 
    checking account.

The next Steering Committee Meeting will be mid March (after EYH).
