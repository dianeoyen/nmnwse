Registration: Carol Ladelfe
School Contact:  Ann Mauzy will send out the intial letter. Nancy Scheer
will work as our LAWIS-AAUW liason because she is a member of both.  AAUW
will go to Santa Fe and try to raise visibility for EYH.
Facilities: Vacant
Transportation: Vacant. Ramit Mehr will not be able to do it this year.

Action Items:

Denise will work on finding instructions for building a tower in small
groups.  We decided that repeating the egg drop might not be good since
some girls will have heard about it from last year.  Other ideas might be
possible also.  We all agreed that having them think up an advertising
jingle was entertaining and educational.

Shirley needs to send a formal letter to Sig asking for his blessing to
have the lab support the EYH activities.

Everyone needs to work on contacting their professional societies to get
career pamphlets to hand out the girls.  We failed this aspect last year.

Denise George thought having a workshop where the girls can build a Web
page would be fun.  Ann Mauzy agreed to try to find someone in CIC who
could lead this workshop.

The next meeting will be in January. Shirley and Joyce will lead that meeting.

After the meeting, Karen talked to a nutritionist from the Wellness Center
who would be willing to do a food science workshop.
