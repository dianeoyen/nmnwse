MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF November 3, 1993

Members of the steering committee met in room T147 of the Ottowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Lois Dauelsberg
    Denise George
    Shirley Herrera
    Deborah Kubicek
    Karen Schultz Paige
    Jo Skrivan

There was some discussion of the membership information forms. Denise showed the
    board the Network's membership booklet. It was decided to use the Network's
    information update form with a few changes. Karen said she would make the 
    changes and mail out the forms to the members.

Deborah handed out a report she received titled "Women in Technical and 
    Scientific Fields: Results of a National Survey"

Jo announced that Carolyn Robinson has quit the board. There is some question
    as to whether every one does want to be on the committee and whether each
    board member is satisfied with her duties. Those in attendance voiced that
    they were satisfied with their positions.  Discussion of when and how to 
    replace Carolyn will occur at the next meeting.

There was discussion about the attendance (or lack of) at the board meetings.
    A sheet was passed around for all to sign those times that they are able
    to meet (Mon-Fri/noon or evenings). It was decided that we should continue 
    to meet twice a month. We will meet so that between the two meetings, 
    every one will be able to attend. It was also decided that meeting once a 
    month in the evenings would give us more time to get things done.
    Karen and Jo will ask those members who were not present when they are 
    available.

It was suggested that sub groups get together to discuss some agenda issues 
    because it was felt that not enough is getting accomplished at the board 
    meetings. The first two agenda items from today's agenda will be dealt with 
    in this manner (as a trial).

Lois and Denise will get together to discuss the agenda item:
    Update membership information
    - how to go about storing membership information
        - which machine
        - which data base
        - who is to control data
        - what to store

At the next meeting a committee will be formed to deal with the next agenda
    item: the next Newsletter.

Denise will attempt to scan in the Bylaws to get a more maintainable copy.

The next meeting will tentatively be (depending on whether Linda, Leslie, and 
    Elizabeth can attend) Wednesday Nov. 17th in the evening (at about 4:30pm) 
    at Denise's home. The following meeting is for Friday December 3rd 
    (possibly also in the evening).

Annual Agenda:
    * Increase membership with the help of two sub issues:
      * Networking
      * Educational Outreach
