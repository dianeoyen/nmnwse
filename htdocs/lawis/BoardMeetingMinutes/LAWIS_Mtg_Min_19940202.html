Members of the steering committee met in room E-228 of the Ottowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Denise George
    Shirley Herrera 
    Deborah Kubicek
    Karen Schultz Paige

    Lynda Towers

    Wendee Brunish

    Pat Nickel 
    Alexine Salazar
    Carol Wilkinson

This meeting was dedicated mainly to planning for Expanding Your Horizons.

Local Science Fair (Saturday Feb. 5th):
    Denise wished to use WIS money to give science fair prizes to elementary
    aged girls?. She suggested seven $10 gift certificates to Ottowi 
    Station Bookstore and a $75 scholarship to the Children's College
    which is at UNM-LA during the summer. A vote was made and it was a
    unanimous vote of the 6 board members present to go ahead with this.
    Denise will ask Ottowi Station if they would consider donating one or
    more of the gift certificates. Wendee and Denise will help with the
    Science Fair Judging this Saturday.

Wendee mentioned that a number of employees are getting together to see about 
    getting a union started at the Laboratory. If anyone is interested in
    going to the meeting it will be Feb 21st. Contact Wendee for further 
    details.

Wendee mentioned that Public Affairs wants to know if the WIS wanted to get 
    involved with the Women and Daughters activity in April. The WIS board 
    members agreed unanimously that they do not have the time due to EYH 
    and Careers and Curiosities and that the WIS want to focus on girls 
    that do not have direct exposure (by a parent) to the sciences.

Shirley announced that Gloria Cordova from Public Relations wishes to become
    a liaison to the WIS. This was unanimously agreed upon by the board.

Next meeting will be around Noon on Thursday Feb. 10th. Karen will arrange 
    the room at send us all out notices.

       Settled Issues:
         Roberta took last years and reworked it
         A copy of the budget was sent around - many question marks
         WIS treasure has about $1000 in it
         Gloria Cordova from Public Affairs was contacted about financial/
           other support: They will help with anything that needs Xeroxing, 
           mailing, funding folders, etc.
         Shirley contacted Protocol about getting help. Protocol says that 
           since this is such a short notice, they will not be able to help
           at all.
         Denise asked Linda Trocki help w/ funding. Probably will not help.
           Unable to contact.
         Cut off Date for contributors is Feb 16th (brochure deadline)

    b. Suggestions for T-shirts, buttons, etc.

       OUTSTANDING Issues:
         Denise will go to Office Club to look for "give aways".
         Pat and Lynda look in Sam's Club for ideas for "give aways".
         These items need to be decided/ordered SOON!

       Settled Issues:
         Karen looked into scientific gadgets/toys
         Lois looked into Protocol for money and/or give away items: None
         It is believed that the Network has rules regarding the amount WIS 
           can give toward transportation. Last year we gave $90.
         We have 9 T-shirts remaining from last year. It was suggested that 
           these be given away in a drawing for the girls.
         Was suggested to have the raffle directly after lunch (must be 
           present to win) in order to get the girls back in time for 
           the afternoon session.

         Settled Issues:
           Shirley will check with Protocol about getting these ordered:
             Hot cocoa for the morning
             Cookies and punch for the afternoon
           Prices: $ .45 /person/coffee
