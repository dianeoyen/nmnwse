The Expanding Your Horizon conference was held on March 20, 1996.  Over 90
young women grades 8th thru 12th participated from Northern New Mexico.  

The morning session involved a team activity in which the participants had
to build a tower that could support a golf ball.  The girls were paired in
teams and did a great job of building the tower.  The winners were
determined by the heighth of the tower and whether the tower could hold the
golf ball.  After lunch time, each team had to present an advertisement of
why we should buy their tower. The teams had a lot of fun with it and there
were great responses.

The girls were also involved in the morning and afternoon hands-on workshops
with women scientists and engineers.

The afternoon session included two speakers, Ines Triay, a lab manager and
Dr. Kathleen Ramsay, a veterarian.  Ines Triay gave a brief biography of her
science career and what her group does at the lab.  Dr. Kathleen Ramsay
spoke about the wildlife center and some of the world's endangered species.
She also brings animals from the wildlife center.  The participants really
enjoy Dr. Ramsay's talk and enjoy seeing the various wildlife she brings
with her.

From the questionaires, the participants felt the conference was very
informative and enjoyed what they learned.

Again many thanks to those of you who contributed to the conference, without
everyones help it would not be possible.
