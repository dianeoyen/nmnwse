phone numbers, and addresses.

The new steering committee decided that a specific person should be
responsible for each of the major events to occur during the next year.
Those events will include:

    Expanding your Horizons
    Science Fair
    Spring Colloquium
    Annual Meeting
    Membership Tea
    Summer Picnic
    Christmas Breakfast

Jo asked that several agenda issues be listed:

    Positions still to be filled: public relations (try to recruit Gloria) 
        and special event heads

    Whether to delete or add special projects

    Scheduling/organizing for large major events

    Ideas for internal (LANL) focus that would help increased membership

    Start the new membership year (with NM Network) in October -- terms for
        steering committee would remain as is (July 1 - June 30)

    Special jobs - recruit membership assistance, whether WIS to become a
        Club 1663 subclub, someone to take care of copying/labels/mailing
        problems, minority recruitment and interface with minority 
        organizations, microfiche project of WIS records

    Establish deadlines for newsletter input

    Decide what WIS records to keep (eg. only 2-3 years of minutes)

    Develop a budget

    Attach a membership list to the first newsletter and a form for address 
        correction
    
    Another session of organizing records needs to be scheduled.


Jo will review minutes before distribution. Karen will get a copy of the 
WIS bylaws to everyone on the steering committee along with the next 
meeting's notice.

Deborah offered to store the boxes of WIS records in her home until something 
can be done with them (eg. microfiche).
