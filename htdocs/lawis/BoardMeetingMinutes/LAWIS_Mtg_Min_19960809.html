Minutes for the Los Alamos Women in Science Steering Committee meeting held
on Friday, August 8 at noon in Room E228 of the Otowi Building. Attending
were Wendee Brunish, Karen Schultz Paige, Deborah Kubicek, Libby Jones,
Trish Wright.

The first item of business was discussion of the amount of money that LAWIS
should donate to the Georgia Fritz Memorial Scholarship fund at UNM-LA..
Trish gave us a treasurer's report that indicated that LAWIS has 3000$.
Trish suggested donating 500$ in the name of Georgia. The amount was voted
on and passed unanimously. Trish will send a check to UNM-LA.

The next item of business is the impending vote on new members for the
steering committee. Karen volunteered to be the Nominations Committee
Chairperson. She will find two other members to help with nominations
although some thought that nominations could largely be completed by one
person. Karen will send a membership-wide email to call for nominations.
Deborah has an alias on her machine that anyone can use. It is
WIS-members@klaatu.lanl.gov. If there are not enough volunteers, the
nominations committee will call people directly.

Once the nominees have been identified, a ballot will be sent out through
the mail. Deborah will provide address labels to Karen and Karen will mail
the ballots. The winners will be announced at the local Annual Meeting.
Committee members stepping down this year include Bonnie Yantis, Deborah
Kubicek, and Shirley Herrera. We presumed that Shirley will be stepping
down but Karen will confirm this with Shirley. Wendee Brunish and Libby
Jones would like to step down but are willing to remain on the committee if
not enough nominees are identified.

Wendee gave us an update on the local Annual meeting. It will be held at
Central Avenue Grill on Sept. 18 from 11:45 to 1:00. Elizabeth Aiello will
be speaking about the highlights and contributions that Georgia Fritz made
to our organization, particularly in the early days. Tickets, printed by
Deborah, will be used to keep track of attendance. Probably a choice of
three entrees will be given. Karen will find out if we can announce and
possibly invite the Georgia Fritz scholarship winner.

Deborah updated us on the State Annual Meeting. The Annual Meeting
Committee did not meet at all during the summer. We did just have a meeting
August 1st though. Ann Mauzy has found us a storyteller for our Saturday
evening entertainment. Her name is Maureena Manyfingers, who is a
Yakima/Cowlitze Native American. Dede Collins will be soliciting Packards
in Santa Fe for her fees. Packards is "the most reliable Indian Arts and
Crafts store in Santa Fe for 35+ years".

We need to find out why the July Newsletter did not go out. If it will not
go out within the next week, we will have to send the registration and Call
for Papers forms out ourselves.  Lapel pins and key chains have been
ordered and should be ready by the first of September. Alexine Salazar will
begin collecting material to go inside the registration packets. Alexine
will also be designing and creating the name tags. Wyona Turner has agreed
to have a person at the registration table (either herself or a volunteer)
to collect renewal membership dues, new member dues, and answer any
questions people might have about the NMNWSE. Deborah Kubicek will be
creating the Agenda for the conference with help from the other committee
members. Ann Mauzy will be designing and creating the Program.

We have decided to dedicate the Annual meeting to Georgia Fritz. We may
have a poster about her (if we get someone to agree to put this together).
We will be scheduling a period of time for people to meet, go through
Georgia's Women in Science boxes, and reminisce about her. We will also
have a formal presentation at the beginning of the conference Friday about
Georgia and why we are dedicating the meeting to her. Speaker to be
determined.

Deborah also updated us on the most recent meeting of the State Board. The
State agreed to donate 100$ to the Georgia Fritz Memorial. Deborah has
agreed to help audit the State's books before the Annual Meeting since she
is going to be their Treasurer. Rachel Pitts, the current Treasurer,
Deborah, Libby Haas, current president, and Lynda Towers, president-elect
will create a future budget to be voted on at the annual meeting. Kelly
Bitner will be president-elect next year.
