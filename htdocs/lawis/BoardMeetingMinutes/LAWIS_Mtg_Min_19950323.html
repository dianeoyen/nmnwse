Re:     LAWIS Steering Committee Meeting March 23, 1995


The LAWIS Steering Committee met in Otowi E228.  Those attending were
Deborah Kubicek, Karen Schultz Paige, Denise George, Trish Wright, Shirley
Herrera, Wendee Brunish, and Kathryn Strong.

The next meeting will be the week of April 3, 1995; Karen will arrange a
room and precise date.

Review of Past Projects.
    Luncheon: 
    The Feb 14, 1995 Alicia Lauritzen presented a talk entitled "Wintertine,
    Darktime, Dreamtime: Embracing the Dark Side of the Soul."  Approximately 
    25 people attended the LA Inn luncheon.  Comments on the talk were very
    positive but the menu was perceived as just adequate.

    Science Fair:
    The Science Fair was judged by Denise George and Wendee Brunish.  Eight
    gift certificates to the Otowi Book store were given out: 1 Grand prize 
    for $25, a 2nd prize of $15 and six 3rd prizes of $10.

    EYH:
    Shirley reported on EYH which had an excellent attendance of 100 
    students thanks to lots of last minute phone calls coordinated by Denise 
    George. Overall the program went smoothly with name tags being the 
    largest problem. A celebration dinner will be held for all those who 
    participated.  The date is still to be arranged.

    Television:
    Karen previewed the KNME-TV Discovering Women tapes March 18, 1995.  
    The 6 hours to be aired March 29-April 12, 1995 appear to be excellent.  
    These will be taped and put in the WIS library along the Critical Mass 
    Tape copied from Carol Wilkenson's tape.

Position Reports
    Treasury:
    We still need one other person to audit the books.  Mary Jo Lundy has 
    done this for one signature and has been given a free membership in 
    return. There is confusion over $625 dollars that Susan Roach deposited.  
    Trish will look into this.  There is also confusion on whether we need 
    to file a State Corporation Commission report or whether we are included 
    in the NMNWSE charter as a subchapter.

    Programs:
    The report on the Working Women survey mailed to all LANL female employees
    is complete.  A noon time presentation is planned with Wendee Brunish
    leading the discussion.  Over 1000 Laboratory women completed the survey.
    Results will be published in the WIS Newsletter and on internet.  In
    addition a one page summary will be available at the presentation with a
    sign up sheet for employees who want copies but are not able to access the
    internet.

    Two sessions, 16 people each, are planned with Rosalie Multari doing a
    demonstration on women's self defense.  A $5.00 cover charge will be asked.
    Rosalie will get a free membership.

    Dorothy Hoard is planning on giving a nature walk probably in June.

    Membership:
    Due to a down computer, membership numbers and the booklet are on hold.
    "Who We Are" brochure is ready for duplication.  We will try to get paper
    for that from the NMNWSE.

    Newsletter:
    The next newsletter will come out in April.  All submittals are due to
    Susan Roach Monday April 3.

    Diversity:
    A draft strategic plan has been completed by Nick Ovalle's Office and 
    will be circulated for comment.  Stakeholder meetings that were conducted 
    by Sig Hecker brought diversity issues to his attention, especially at 
    the Espanola meeting Feb 28, 1995. The LLC Resource Working Group will 
    be having a series of focus group discussions on employee issues.  
    Heidi Hahn is in charge.  There is a training video which will be made
    on diversity.

New Business:
    Donations:
    We need to form a policy on who we donate money to.  A quorum is needed.  
    A request from the YMCA has made this need apparent.

    UNM-LA Mentorship Program:
    Following a WIS presentation by Jo and Deborah, twenty-one women covered 
    in a UNM-LA grant program have requested a mentor.  Twenty-four signed up 
    with WIS members.  These women will get a free student WIS membership.
