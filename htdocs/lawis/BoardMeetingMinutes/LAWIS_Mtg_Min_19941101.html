To:     LAWIS Steering Committee
From:   Kathryn Strong, HR T&D, Secretary
Re:     LAWIS Steering Committee Meeting Nov 1, 1994

The new LAWIS Steering Committee met at Jo Irwin's home at 121 Canyon Vista
in White Rock.  Those attending with their new office title were:
    Deborah Kubicek------President
    Karen Schultz Paige--Vice President
    Kathryn Strong-------Secretary
    Trish Wright---------Treasurer
    Denise George--------Membership
    Shirley Herrera------EYH
    Jo Irwin-------------EYH and NMNWSE Liaison
    Susan Roach----------Newsletter
    Lynda Towers---------NMNWSE Board
    Wendee Brunish-------EAC Chairman (nonofficial)

After a dinner provided by Jo Irwin, the group elected officers.  Each
officer received a folder with specific duties.  Additional information
about the organization including by-laws, NMNWSE, and common duties such as
coordinator and program tasks was also passed out.  These folders are to be
passed on to successors next year.

There was no budget report since Lois Dauelsberg, past treasurer, has not
closed the books.  An audit will take place using two people with one from
the steering committee.  Cindy Sievers has volunteered to be the other
person.  A special account has been opened for EYH bringing to total of four
accounts at the Credit Union; the other three are scholarship, savings, and
checking. Wright, Roach, and Kubicek all have access to the accounts.  While
an exact figure is not known, our EYH budget currently has $500 which
includes $200 to be returned from the state organization.  The rebate from
the state will go from $5 to $15 this year.  While the rebate does not occur
until September 1995, we will be able to withdraw earlier if we need it for
operations.

Directly tied to budget is membership.  Some people have paid directly into
NMNWSE so current numbers are not exact.  Kubicek has 26 sign up sheets.  In
the past enrollment has been around 100 but no one has checked membership
against mailings last year so there is confusion on where the organization
really stands on this issue.  After membership data is collected, delinquent
notices will go out in December.  There will be a new drive for membership
which will involve a contest which will be announced in the upcoming
Newsletter.  Kubicek also presented a her suggested
list of items to appear in that Newsletter.

Additional announcements came from Brunish asking for volunteers to compile
the 1000 returns from  the Women's Bureau Survey.  She also asked if anyone
would serve on the Workforce Resilience Project led by Phillips and Wadt
which is meeting weekly.  Irwin and Wright volunteered.  Irwin brought up
the diversity issue which was discussed. Strong is working in that arena and
will keep the Committee informed as LANL plans unfold.  The question was
raised on whether LAWIS wanted to focus on this issue.

The board will meet once a month with bi-weekly alternate monthly meetings
with the Expanding Your Horizon's (EYH) committee.  The next EYH meeting is
Nov 17 in Otowi at noon.  Our next meeting will be Nov 30, 1994 at noon also
in the Otowi building.  Karen will arrange a room.  A Membership Christmas
Wine party will be held at Deborah Kubicek's home 995 Tsankawi in Los Alamos
Dec 7 from 5:00-7:00.  There will be a $1.00 charge mostly to confirm
attendance.
