                      - Sonic - Shirley
         Shirley will call Kathy Campbell to find out the exact starting 
           balance.
         Checkbook needs to be gotten from Georgia.
         

       Settled Issues:
         Roberta took last years and reworked it
         A copy of the budget was sent around - many question marks
         WIS treasure has about $1000 in it
         Gloria Cordova from Public Affairs was contacted about financial/
           other support: They will help with anything that needs Xeroxing, 
           mailing, funding folders, etc.
         Shirley contacted Protocol about getting help. Protocol says that 
           since this is such a short notice, they will not be able to help
           at all.
         Denise asked Linda Trocki help w/ funding. Probably will not help.
           Unable to contact.
         Cut off Date for contributors is Feb 16th (brochure deadline)
         It was decided to not spend every penny we had but to leave some 
           for next year to get started with.

    b. Suggestions for T-shirts, buttons, etc.

       OUTSTANDING Issues:
         T-shirts need to be redesigned. 
         T-shirts need to be ordered. 
         We have 9 T-shirts remaining from last year. It was suggested that 
           these be given away in a drawing for the girls. What to do with 
           now that we are getting t-shirts for all girls?
         Karen will look into getting a few scientific projects/gadgets 
           to raffle. She will look in Otowi Station and other places.

       Settled Issues:
         Karen looked into scientific gadgets/toys
         Lois looked into Protocol for money and/or give away items: None
         It is believed that the Network has rules regarding the amount WIS 
           can give toward transportation. Last year we gave $90.
         Was suggested to have the raffle directly after lunch (must be 
           present to win) in order to get the girls back in time for 
           the afternoon session.
         Pat went to Sam's Club. No real good selection of "give aways".
         It was decided to go with T-shirts again as "give aways". 
         Jo was volunteered to call places about getting the shirts 
           themselves ordered. If She could find a place where the shirts 
           are $5.00 or less, she can order them. Otherwise the EYH committee 
           will have to approve them.

    c. Refreshments (Shirley)

         OUTSTANDING Issues:
           Shirley will see about ordering the refreshments.

         Settled Issues:
           Shirley will check with Protocol about getting these ordered:
             Hot cocoa for the morning
             Cookies and punch for the afternoon
           Prices: $ .45 /person/coffee
                   $ .45 /person/hot cocoa
                   $ .50 /person/cookie
                   $ .65 /person/punch
                   $ .75 /person/soda
           Note: These prices do include set up and clean up
           Approved:
             (1 coffee/hot cocoa + 1 soda + 2 cookies) * 200 people = $440.00

           "Women in Science Critical Mass" we can possibly show during 
           registration. This video is in an MTV style advertisement to

           Technology (Carolyn Mangeng). She is one of the highest ranked 
           women at the Lab).

         Alexine Salazar contacted Gloria Cordova about being the opening 
           speaker for the conference. She accepted.
         Lynda talked to Dr. Kathleen Ramsay about being the closing speaker.
           She accepted and will also probably participate in a workshop.
         Wendee prepared a letter to go out to Robin Marshment to invite 
           her to be the second speaker for opening. She accepted but ...
         Robin Marshment would like to come but has a problem with early 
           morning.  Wendee will call Robin about switching. Robin will do

         Big discussion about evaluations: was unable to get anything very 
           informative from last years evaluations. 
         What is the purpose of the evaluations? To see if something needs 
           to be changed (ie. demos too technical)
         Do we want information back about certain aspects? 
           Individual presentations and whether this will influence them 
           about math/science in the future, etc.
         Do we need to rewrite the evaluation forms? Yes
