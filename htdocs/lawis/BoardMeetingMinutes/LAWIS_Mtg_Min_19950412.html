Minutes for LAWIS board meeting, April 12, 1995
Attendees:  Wendee Brunish, Deborah Kubicek, Shirley Herrera, Karen Schultz
Paige, Trish Wright, Jo Irwin

Position Reports:
VP: Karen reported that everything was set for Rosalie Multari's self
  defense workshop on May 1.  Karen will contact Susan to make sure the
  announcement gets in the newsletter.  She will also ask Susan to put in a
  note about Wendee's talk on the Work Women Count! survey on May 23rd.
  Wendee will provide Karen with a cost code to charge the overhead machine
  costs for her talk.
Treasurer: Trish handed out current budget.  She noted that the amount on the
  last line of last page should read $1,124.04.  She mentioned that checks
  for membership are missing and she would try to locate them.  Trish 
  discovered that the State Corporation papers do not need to filled out 
  since we  are covered by NMNWSE's papers now.  We need to get tax-free 
  forms from them now.  Trish will get some and keep them on hand.  
  All agreed that we should make sure that we have no outstanding debts 
  from past unpaid corporation documents.
Membership:  We all think the new NMNWSE membership booklets look great
  (Good job, Lynda!).  Since the Northern Chapter's members are included, we
  decided we don't need to make our own.  However, we should get extra copies
  to give to new members, etc....
EYH:  There will be an EYH party at Wendee's house at 5:30 on May 5.
  Shirley will coordinate it.  Shirley will also provide a paragraph write-up
  on our EYH Conference for the State.  Fundraising results for EYH need to
  be sent to Yolanda Jones King at the State.  Surveying Your Future booklets
  need to be rewritten by June/July.  200 will be printed for us for EYH 96.
NMNWSE Liaison:  Deborah attended instead of Jo. Deborah has the minutes if
  anyone is interested.  We may get bigger rebates from the State than the 
  $15 we currently get.  We got a reissue of the check that is missing from 
  the State for 93-94 membership rebates.

"Who we are" pamphlets:  Deborah has purchased paper and made some up.  She
has a very special technique for folding them that we will all learn at a
folding party coming soon.  The State will give us up to $100 to make these
up.  Shirley will find out how to get them put into new hire packages.  We
decided that would provide the greatest exposure.  Jo will distribute to 
the UNM-LA campus. We will also have them at our functions.  Other possible 
uses for the pamphlets will be tried out later.

NMNWSE Annual Meeting:  Will be very fun and interesting this year.  Dates
are Oct. 21-22 and location is a field station south of ABQ.  Very cheap,
kind of like camping only not quite.

Next Board Meeting: Deborah thinks we should go to monthly meetings.  
Our next meeting will be from noon to 1:30 in Room E228 on Wed, May 10th.
