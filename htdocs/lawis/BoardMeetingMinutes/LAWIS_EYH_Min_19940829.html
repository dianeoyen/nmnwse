Contact Shirley if you would like a job but were unable to attend.  
There were a few sub-committees that still need heads.

Two people were mentioned as possible speakers:  Rita Martinez-Purson, 
and Barbara Stien, DX Deputy Division Director.

The tower building exercise used by the Southern Chapter at their EYH 
was discussed.  It was suggested that this could be at the beginning 
of the day and take the place of a morning speaker.

Having an essay contest similar to the one at the '93 EYH was 
discussed.  It was mentioned that the response was poor.  It was 
suggested that we come up with an idea that would be a project for the 
school and the school or class would win a prize.  One idea was 
"Describe an experiment to go on a shuttle mission."

The committee decided to meet once a month until January.  The next 
meeting will be Tuesday, Sept. 20.  Karen will reserve a room and 
contact everyone.

After many of the committee had left dede brought up that the Network 
wants to update the "Surveying Your Future" EYH handout.  We need 
volunteers to look at their field and see if the current write-up 
needs to be revised. Also if there are new fields that need to be 
added.  If you know the original author and would be willing to ask if 
they would look it over that would be helpful, too.  Please contact 
dede, 5-2349, if you would be interested.  The write-ups are 1 1/2 
pages long and have the format of answering these 5 questions:  "What 
is a Chemist/etc.?", What makes a good chemist/etc.?", "What is life 
as a chemist/etc. like?", "How do I become a chemist/etc.?", and 
"Where are the jobs".  The current career fields are:
