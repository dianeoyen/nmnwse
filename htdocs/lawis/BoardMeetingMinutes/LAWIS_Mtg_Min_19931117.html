MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF November 17, 1993

Members of the steering committee met at Denise's House.
Attending members were:
    Lois Dauelsberg
    Denise George
    Deborah Kubicek
    Jo Skrivan
    Leslie Swanson
    Lynda Towers


The Newsletter was discussed. Inputs were suggested including notice about dues. 
    The Newsletter should go out soon. It was suggested that a sub-group get 
    together to organize it.

The Holiday Party is soon. Scheduled for December 15th from 4:30 to 5:30pm.
    Jo will get a room. Should tell about it in the Newsletter, flyers to
    WIS members, and in the Lab Newsbulletin.

The gopher networking system was mentioned. Denise reported that a section has
    already been created. Directions on how to access it: once into the gopher 
    system choose "Network News (USENET)". Then choose "LANL Specific Newsgroups".
    Then choose "women". Under this section, letters are posted.  See agenda 
    below for my (Deborah's) suggestions. I am including with these minutes 
    information about the gopher system. Please look over and bring to the next 
    board meeting.

Lois reported that 38 out of 120 WIS members have returned their membership 
    information update form.

Talk of the Bylaws: Denise got them on a floppy including the new changes
    Next meeting the board will look over and decide whether to approve them.

Jo discussed a letter she received about a DOE study about the rate of women
    versus men who drop out of college level programs. She has asked for the 
    complete study. After she receives more information, the board felt they 
    need to discuss the study and how the WIS can help in this area 
    (ie. meeting with the Los Alamos branch of UNM to start something ...
    special classes for women?).

Next meeting will be Noon on Friday Dec. 3rd. Karen will arrange the room 
    (we hope) at sent us all out notices.

Annual Agenda:
    * Increase membership with the help of two sub issues:
      * Networking
      * Educational Outreach
