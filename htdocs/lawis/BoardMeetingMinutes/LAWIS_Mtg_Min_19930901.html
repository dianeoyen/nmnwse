MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF September 1, 1993

Members of the steering committee met in room T-147 of the Ottowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Elizabeth Aiello
    Denise George
    Shirley Herrera
    Deborah Kubicek
    Carolyn Robinson
    Karen Schultz Paige
    Jo Skrivan

Jo discussed the meeting she attended between the Women's Committee and
    Frances Menlove. Frances does not want to send out the grievance survey
    that the Women's Committee put together. She feels it needs to be
    more technical and done on a more professional level. Frances wants to
    send out a survey in about 6 months to encompass several issues, one
    of which is the grievance process. The Women's Committee and Frances 
    both held their sides. Frances did agree that and exit survey needs to
    be developed and administered. No date for that was set though. 
    
    After the meeting, Jo suggested to the Women's Committee that they work
    with Frances on creating a mutually satisfactory survey. 
    
    The WIS steering committee agreed that the Women's Committee needs to take
    a different tactic but that at this point it is in the Women's Committee's
    hands. It was noted that if a survey was given without the Lab's
    approval, there is no guarantee that the Lab will accept the results.

    It was suggested possibly taking this issue to the Network meeting and 
    see if there is an interest in doing a survey on a broader area: Northern
    New Mexico (ie. to include LANL, Sandia, etc.).

Video: the reception is to  be delayed till later in the year. The Women's 
    Committee was unable to get the enough funding for production so that 
    has been dropped.

A few minutes were spent discussing the Annual Agenda. 
    The board would like to find a way to mail out "stuff" to specific groups
    of people at the Lab. Due to the sensitivity of personnel files, we do 
    not know if this is possible.  Karen is going to look into finding out a 
    way to either get distribution lists (ie. all women at the Lab) or 
    a mechanism to mail out to a specific group of people.

Deborah discussed here thoughts on increasing membership: update WIS members
    addresses, etc., put out the Newsletter more often to keep the member more
    in touch with what the board is doing. It was suggested that a Newsletter
    go out within the next month to include a membership list and a change of
    information sheet. Deborah will call Lois to see if she will bring that 
    to the next board meeting so that the Newsletter can go out ASAP.

There was also some concern about whether the board members are satisfied 
    with being on the board and with their positions. This will be addressed
    at the next board meeting. SO, if you are unhappy at all, make sure you 
    show up or talk to Jo. There was also a concern about having to wait so 
    long for people to show up for the meetings. PLEASE, IF YOU ARE GOING TO 
    BE LATE OR ARE UNABLE TO MAKE IT, CALL KAREN (OR ANYONE).

The next board meeting will be in 2-3 weeks at Denise's home at 5:15pm on a Mon. 
    or Wed., when ever we are able to get Georgia to attend. Karen will send out
    notices when the date has been determined.
