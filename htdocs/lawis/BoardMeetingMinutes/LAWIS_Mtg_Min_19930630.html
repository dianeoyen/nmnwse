MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF June 30, 1993

Members of the steering committee met in room E-128 of the Ottowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Lois Dauelsberg
    Denise George
    Shirley Herrera
    Deborah Kubicek
    Karen Schultz Paige
    Carolyn Robinson
    Jo Skrivan

It was decided to move the financial year to coincide with the membership year.
Because of this, the annual audit will be delayed till October.

Gloria Cordova agreed to help with recruitment.

Gloria gave Jo a list of special interest groups at the laboratory. Jo would 
    like a liaison from the steering committee for each of the groups:
        African American  -  Jo
        American Indian   -  Deborah
        Asian Pacific     -  Denise
        Club 1663         -  ? Leslie
        Hispanic Council  -  Shirley
        Women's Committee -  Carolyn, Karen
        WorkForce 2000    -  Lois
    After the annual agenda is determined, we need to become more involved in
    these special interest groups.  The purpose of being liaisons with these 
    groups is to work together on issues in common and to offer our help when
    needed.  The people assigned to these groups should get on the group's 
    mailing list and go to meetings when common issues are discussed.

Jo got with Club 1663 to gather information about WIS joining them. We just 
    need to fill out an application form and give them a copy of our financial 
    statement and ByLaws.

Special projects: remaining project heads were decided. 
        Science Fair            (Feb '94)       - Denise
        Expanding your Horizons (March '94)     - Shirley 
        Spring Colloquium       (Early May '94) - Shirley and Jo
        Summer Picnic           (Aug)           - Karen and Shirley
        Annual Meeting          (Oct)           - Karen
        Membership Fling        (Early Nov)     - Carolyn and Lois
        Christmas Breakfast     (Dec)           - Lynda and Deborah

Karen will schedule the time/place for the July 13th and July 27th board meetings
    and then send notices to all board members and Gloria.  The next two 
    meetings were scheduled so that Gloria would be able to attend in order
    to discuss recruitment. Jo will call Gloria and Lynda Towers to make
    sure they will be able to attend on the dates above.

Jo would like someone to gather statistics about pay equity.

Before the next meeting, Jo would like the board members to:
    Look over the ByLaws for needed changes
    Think of issues you would like to see on the annual agenda

Karen had received a "Rainbow packet" from AA/EEO containing valuable statistics.
Deborah will get copies of these for the rest of the board.
