MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF October 5, 1994

Members of the steering committee met in Side Room A of the Otowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Lois Dauelsberg
    Shirley Herrera
    Deborah Kubicek
    Susan Roach
    Karen Schultz Paige
    Lynda Towers
    Trish Wright
    Wendee Brunish

Wendee Brunish's talk
    Had a great turnout. Probably over 50 women. Suggestion that next time 
    we should bring the LAWIS Membership form to all our sponsored activities.

Membership Application Packet  
    Done and sent out to many people. Already several new members have joined.

Newsletter
    Sent out. Suggestion that try to double side as much as possible to help
    in our part of reducing waste.

What about LAWIS getting a post office box? Costs $17.50 / 6 mo. (small box)
    This issue was discussed and it was decided that it would be too much 
    of an inconvenience for someone to have to check the mailbox often. The
    return labels that get sent out on outside mailings will have to be
    tailored each time depending on who is sending the mailing out.

October Los Alamos WIS Annual Membership meeting Update
    Pretty much organized: setup for LA INN from 11:30 to 1:30 Mon. Oct 17th.
    Karen will do the ice breaker. Lynda will do the introduction of dede.
    The head table will seat the speaker (dede) and the past board members.
    Lynda will get a plant for the head table for decoration and to give to
    dede for speaking. We will have a table for membership in order to take
    applications/dues and to answer any questions. Trish and Susan will man
    that table. Lynda will see about making a program. Deborah bring name
    tags.

End of Year summary from each board member
    Deborah has only received two of these! PLEASE get them to her by Oct 17th
    (at the Annual Meeting).

Treasurer '93 - '94 Account Audit:
      Lois will contact Mary Jo Lundy about possibly auditing our accounts in
    exchange for a LAWIS annual membership. She will contact Mary Jo as soon
    as she is able to get the books in order.
      The name on the account will be changed from Women in Science to
    LA Women in Science/NMNWSE. This will help with the cashing of checks 
    made out to both. In order to make this change, Lois needs some kind of 
    proof of association with the NMNWSE. Deborah will send her a copy of
    the Newsletter where that change was announced.
      The account should probably have three names on it: Treasurer of LAWIS,
    Treasurer of EYH, and a back up for the LAWIS Treasurer (President?).
    When the board positions are filled Lois will get the signature card to
    pass around for the new people to sign.

Assignment of board members to '94 - '95 positions
    It was found out that the new board positions have to be filled by a
    vote from the board members. We therefore have to wait until the new
    board is determined. We will try to hold a VERY quick board meeting 
    directly following the Annual meeting in order to elect officers.

Lynda is thinking of accepting the position of Membership for the Network. 
    if she does, we need to find someone else who will the the liaison for
    the NMNWSE from the Northern Chapter. They probably meet quarterly.

Wendee mentioned that the Employee Advisory Council (EAC) has been formed
    to help make recommendations to its sponsor Jim Jackson about
    Laboratory concerns. Wendee is the Chair of that committee so you can 
    take concerns to her. Try to get this out as an announcement in our next 
    Newsletter.

Wendee needs articles on Women's studies mostly having to do with how they
    juggle all aspects of their life. If you have any articles about
    women's studies please get them to Wendee by the end of the week.

There are several members on the board who are interested in certain board 
    positions for next year: President - Deborah; Vice-president - Karen; 
    Treasurer - Trish; Membership - Denise; Newsletter - Susan

Deborah received a call from Chris Olivara from the Science Museum. The
    museum is putting on a program called High Tech Halloween on Oct 29th.
    He was interested in us supporting this event in some way. He suggested
    a donation of money, getting a cow for them to allow kids to dismember,
    or volunteers of time. Denise had suggested earlier to him about one of
    our members doing a "slim making" presentation. The board felt the cow
    thing was out of the question. The board also felt that the Museum probably
    has more money than the LAWIS, so no donations of money. Two suggestions
    were made: Have Chris contact Kathleen Ramsey for an animal to dismember and
    an offer of one of our member's time for the slim making presentation.
    Deborah will call Chris back with these suggestions.

Deborah received a request from a women in NIS/DO for our membership list.
    She felt very hesitant about allowing that out so she asked what it 
    was needed it for. The woman needed a list of LAWIS people who were in 
    NIS Division. A list was mailed to her containing only LANL specific 
    information (Phone #, MS, group). It was agreed by the board that we 
    should not be giving out our membership list. Requests should be 
    considered carefully and our members should be guaranteed some sort 
    of confidentiality.

Deborah received a thank out note from Alicia about the talk she gave. 
    Attached was a list of courses she offers at the Santa Fe Community 
    College. She said she would be willing to make them into lectures if we 
    would like to have her speak again.

Find out who is in the Northern Chapter of NMNWSE but NOT in the LAWIS's
    database. Then send those people application/information sheets.
    Deborah found one and is trying to get a hold of NMNWSE's membership
    person in order to get her address.

The next Steering Committee Meeting will be Tue. November 1st at Jo's home.
    Notices will be sent out to all 94-95 board members when the new board
    is determined. There will be a brief meeting after the Annual Meeting in
    order to elect officers.
