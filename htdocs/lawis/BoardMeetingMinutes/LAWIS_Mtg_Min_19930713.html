MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF July 13, 1993

Members of the steering committee met in room E-128 of the Ottowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Lois Dauelsberg
    Georgia Fritz
    Shirley Herrera
    Deborah Kubicek
    Karen Schultz Paige
    Jo Skrivan
    Leslie Swanson
    Lynda Towers


Deborah handed out rainbow packets to the board.

Newsletter discussion:
    The application to Club 1663 has not yet been turned in. It was decided
    to try to get it in soon but we will not wait on the Newsletter. If unable
    to get admitted to Club 1663 in time, Denise will handle copying of the
    Newsletter, Lois will handle labels, and Leslie (or the board at the
    next board meeting) will handle putting the Newsletter together.

    The date the board wants the Newsletter in people's hands is Friday,
    July 30th (1 week before the Summer Picnic). Therefore, they need to
    be mailed out by Thursday, July 29th. The deadline for getting input
    to Leslie is Wednesday July 21st.

    The Newsletter will contain those items listed on the last agenda along
    with a closing remark from Susan Roach. It was decided that dues for
    the upcoming memship year will be $25 due to Network dues. 

    The Newsletter will be sent out to all people on the membership list
    regardless of whether their dues are paid up or not. This is in hope
    that people will become interested in WIS again and rejoin.


There was some talk of Bylaw changes. The WIS's name is incorporated so any
    change would have to go through the State corporation board. The board
    sees no reason to change the name, just add a blurp ... Los Alamos Women 
    in Science, subchapter of the Northern New Mexico WIS. The board does not 
    want to merge with the Network because it was felt that we would lose
    our identity and focus.

The board is to get together with the Women's Committee informally to discuss
    the Women's Committee Response to Jim Jackson's letter on Special 
    Emphasis groups (WIS is one of the Special Emphasis groups at LANL).
    The meeting is tentatively set for Wednesday August 11th (or the 18th 
    if the 11th is not possible for the Women's Committee).

Karen will schedule the time/place for the July 28th board meeting (note date
    change) and then send notices to all board members.
