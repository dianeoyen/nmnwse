MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF April 5, 1994

Members of the steering committee met in Side Room B of the Otowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Shirley Herrera
    Deborah Kubicek
    Karen Schultz Paige

Due to the number of people attending this meeting, we were unable to get
    much of anything done.

The EYH conference took the board away from its normal duties and it is 
    time to get back on track. We discussed what we thought our most 
    important issues were in an attempt to create a current agenda. It was 
    decided that the two most important issues were: 1) replacing board 
    members 2) updating the data we have on the WIS members (addresses, 
    dues, surveys).

Brainstorming on what we thought the LAWIS "product" could consist of: 
    networking opportunities, social interactions, community outreach
    (eg. EYH and Careers & Curiosity), availability of information relevant
    to women in Science at LANL.

Next meeting will be around noon on Tuesday Apr. 19. Karen will arrange 
    the room at send us all out notices.
