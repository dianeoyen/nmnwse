Members of the new steering committee met in room E-128 of the Ottowi Building.

    Lois Dauelsberg
    Shirley Herrera
    Deborah Kubicek

    Leslie Swanson

Jo will see about getting a hold of Gloria Cordova to recruit for PR.

Invite Gloria to next board meeting - Karen will send her a notice

The board decided to divide the roles of public relations into two areas:
    publicity and recruitment due to the need to focus on both issues.

Elizabeth agreed to be head of publicity (includes Newsbulletin, Update, 
    Monitor, New Mexican?, KRSN?). Special project heads will be 
    responsible for getting necessary information to Elizabeth.

Jo will get with Club 1663 to gather information about WIS joining them.

Special projects: dates were tentatively chosen and some project heads were 
    decided. See the agenda page for details.  Note: it was decided that a 
    project could have more than one head (actually was recommended).
    Project heads are responsible for getting necessary help, organizing, 
    scheduling, and getting information to the publicity person and 
    Newsletter person.

Karen will call the public school system to find out when the Science Fair 
    is scheduled.

The Network's annual meeting will be held Oct 22-24 in Taos at the SageBrush
    Inn.  This year it is sponsored by the Los Alamos Network. The WIS will 
    try to hold their own caucus during that time. Karen will try to schedule
    a separate room for this to be held in.

Jo would like the board and WIS to become more involved in EYH.

Jo will call Carolyn and Denise about heading a special project.

The board discussed calling WIS members to voluteer for a calling committee
    for special events. To be disussed in greater detail later.

Karen and Shirely will head the Summer Picnic. This needs to be organized
    before the next meeting so that details can be put into the Newsletter.

Karen will schedule the time/place for the June 30th board meeting and then
    send notices to all board members and Gloria.

Jo will contact Susan Roach about the annual audit.
