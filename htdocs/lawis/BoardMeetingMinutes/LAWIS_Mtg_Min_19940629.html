MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF June 29, 1994

Members of the steering committee met in Room E228 of the Otowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Denise George
    Shirley Herrera
    Jo Irwin
    Deborah Kubicek
    Karen Schultz Paige

Networking Seminar:
    Talk of the talk, what worked, what did not, and suggestions for next 
    time.  Karen wrote up a summary of the talk and will mail to Leslie 
    to be put into the next Newsletter. The board agreed that the speaker, 
    Rita Martinez-Purson, was great. It was suggested and agreed upon to 
    bring her back if possible for Expanding Your Horizons. Suggestions: 
    open up to more people next time (although we did have a good turn out), 
    possibly do again in 6 months (since many who wished to be there were
    on vacation, etc), next time come a little earlier to set up.

Discussion of mailing lists:
  The DHR has given permission to DeDe Collins, in association with the 
  NMNWSE, to get a list of all women at the laboratory. We will use this 
  list to mail out the Summer Picnic flier since this is our annual 
  recruitment event and need to reach as many as possible. For our membership,
  Shirley created two up-to-date files.  The first called inkjet to be used 
  for mailing fliers. The second called labels to be used for putting labels 
  on stuff to mail. Deborah currently has two disks: each with one of these 
  files on it. We should probably keep these disks and only let CIC-10 
  (Lorraine Ortega Rm 125 of the Canyon Complex - go through Rm 117 to get 
  there) get a copy when we actually mail things out. This way we will be 
  able to update info as needed and know what the current lists look like.

Summer Picnic:
  Deborah and Shirley got together the day before to organize. So far,
  here are the details: Set for Fri. July 29th from 5pm till dark at Urban 
  park. The fees will be $3/person, children under 12 free, and
  $1/student/GRA/PostDoc. Shirley will call the Wellness Center for possible
  equipment rental. The food will be hamburgers, hot dogs, chips, soda, and
  a dessert. Supplies will be gotten the day before the picnic. We will do 
  tickets like we did for the Network talk (since that worked so well). 
  Trish is creating the flier to be mailed out next week Wed (July 6th).
  The fliers will be mailed out to women who are TSM, TECH, SSM, PostDoc, 
  and technical contractors. Reply deadline will be Fri July 22. A reminder
  about the reply deadline will be put into the next Newsletter. We will
  have copies of the "membership survey" at the picnic for anyone interested 
  in joining the Women in Science for 1994-95 year. Karen will get a copy
  of this to Deborah.

Updated membership information will be dealt with by a sub group consisting 
  of Shirley, Lois, Deborah, and Denise. We are hoping this system will be 
  in place by the end of September (before the next year begins). This will
  allow future board members to access membership information when needed.
  Note: And possibly allow access to the information by anyone (eg members).

The membership booklets were put together and mailed out to remaining of
  membership that did not attend the Networking talk.

Deborah's test of the Voicemail mailbox worked great. All board members
    received their message.

August talk:
  Susan said she was unable to get a hold of Donna Giquenta (sp). She will 
  sent her a letter asking if she will speak in Aug. If unable to get a hold
  of her, the board gave Susan permission to change the speaker or even
  change the subject from Dependent Care to what she can find a speaker for.
  A suggestion was made to have Alicia Lauritzen talk on Dream Analysis.
