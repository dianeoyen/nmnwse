MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF July 28, 1993

Members of the steering committee met in room E-128 of the Ottowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Elizabeth Aiello
    Denise George
    Shirley Herrera
    Deborah Kubicek
    Carolyn Robinson
    Karen Schultz Paige
    Jo Skrivan
    Leslie Swanson

Karen will fill out forms to continue our corporation. 

We went over the Bylaws. I will not list all of the changes, but here are a few.
    The fiscal/membership year will be changed to Oct 1 through Sept. 30.
    The board membership terms will also change to the same dates 
        (which is different than what was decided before).
    
    We also decided to start enforcing the section on Dues.  This enforcement
    will include formal individual delinquency notices to members about 
    late dues.

Elizabeth asked Deborah if she would directly mail the minutes of the meetings
    to the President of the New Mexico Network for Women in Science in 
    Engineering.

Denise will help Elizabeth with the technical aspects of Public Relations.

Denise will talk to Georgia about the WIS's name change and if she would 
    help with the wording of the changes to the Bylaws.

Carolyn will call the Women's Committee about deciding a date for getting
    together with them.

The next board meeting will be August 13th at 6:00pm at Deborah's home. The
    meeting will be devoted to setting up our Annual Agenda.
