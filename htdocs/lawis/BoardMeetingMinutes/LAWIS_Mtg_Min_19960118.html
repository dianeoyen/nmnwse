The LAWIS Steering Committee met in Otowi E228 on January 18, 1996.

Those attending were Deborah Kubicek, Karen Schultz Paige,
Wendee Brunish, and Ginger Young.

The next meeting will be held in April.  Karen will arrange the room
 and the precise time.

Agenda Items:

1) Ginger will update us on our next potential membership activity.

Maureen Hudson would love to give a talk on fossils.  Unfortunately,
she is going on vacation for the next will be unavailable until April.
Maureen has given this presentation to WIS 10 years ago, at that time
she gave the talk and then went on a field trip to find fossils at
Battleship Rock.  This sounds like a lot of fun. Ginger will try to set up
a date with Maureen for the April time frame.  The talk would be
given on a Thursday or Friday at noon and the field trip on Saturday.
Battleship Rock is in Bandeliar  in the Jemez Mountains.

2) Continue the debate on honorary membership, addressing the
    question: should we have an information only membership for Sig?

This item was not discussed, since a vote could not occur.

3) Decide is LAWIS should register as an Employee Interest Group.
    Kay might be able to provide more information on this item.

Kay was unable to attend.  No update was available.

4) Decide on what to do with our surplus overhead projector.

We decided to keep the projector until after the annual state
meeting in October.

5)  Shirley will present a summary of the EYH meeting held Jan. 10.

Shirley was unable to attend.  No update was given.

6) Plan our involvement in the 1996 Science Fair.

We are planning to judge and give awards for this year's Science
Fair.  The awards were already budgeted and will be $25, $15, and
$10 gift certificates from the Ottowi Book Store.  The winners will
also be presented certificates of their awards.  Deborah will purchase
the gifts as well as create the certificates.

Judges for the Science Fair will be Karen, Deborah, Wendee, and Ginger.
Judging will take place at the Pueblo Complex on Feb. 9.  The awards will
be presented by Ginger and Deborah at the award ceremony on Feb. 10.

Karen will submit our authorization for the above to The Science Fair
Committee by Feb. 1.

7) News from Deborah on Membership.

Deborah sent out letters to members who have not paid this year's
dues.  Out of twenty-eight letters sent three people submitted
an application and their dues.  The letters were sent out two weeks
ago.

We currently have thirty-nine paid members.

Deborah wanted to know whether she should send out recruiting letters
to members who have not been in the organization for the past few
years.  We decided to wait until the summer membership drive.

Deborah would also like to spilt the data base into two sections.  One
section would contain the information for current members, and
the other would contain information on the old members.
Incorporating old members into the current member's data base
would be easy and no information would be lose.  We all agreed
that it is a wonderful idea and made membership much easier.

8) Plans for the Annual Meeting in Oct.

Deborah is heading the organization of this meeting.  She would like
Karen to ask the State Board for information about last year's
meeting.  The next State Board meeting is being held in Feb.
Deborah would like to know the best way to start the process of
organizing the meeting and when to start announcements.  Karen,
Deborah, and Wendee believe the best contact is Debby Potter.
Unfortunately, the e-mail Deborah has sent has been unanswered &
Deborah is wondering if Debby is on a trip.

9)  Tapes for Discovering Women Series.

Deborah is looking for someone who has copies of the first two hours
of this series.  She would like to borrow these tapes and make a
copy so that our chapter has a complete collection.  Deborah was able to
tape four of the six one hour series, but she missed taping the first
two hours.  If you have a copy please contact Deborah.

10) Resignation.

Kay Strong has resigned from the board.  Her resignation is as follows:

It appears that there is a mismatch on what I could bring to WIS and
what you are looking for in a board member.  Given other priorities
in my life with my positions at LANL, it would be best if I resign from
the WIS board.  Good luck with your endeavors.
>Kay Strong.

11)  Board member replacement : Libby Jones.

Elizabeth (Libby) Jones has accepted Kay's position. Currently,
Libby's schedule is very busy, but she can attend board meetings
until the end of the semester.

Please welcome Libby!
