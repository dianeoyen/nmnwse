LAWIS MINUTES - 2/10/99
(approved)

The Los Alamos Women in Science Steering Committee met in the LANL
cafeteria on Wednesday, February 10, 1999 at 7:15a.m.  Members present were
Ann Mauzy, Margo Clark, Amy Anderson, Sharon Thomas, Susana Delano,
Angelique Neuman, Janie Enter, Mary Steincipher-Campbell, Huyen N. Dinh,
Trish Wright, Cass Mason, Alexine Salazar, and Tinka Gammel.  

* Treasurer's Report:  Trish talked to Ginger Young.  Ginger is in process
of finding someone to audit the books.   Trish suggested that Ginger
contact dede Collins.  Trish said she believes that we have a good balance
of funds.

* Membership Report:  Susana said she had a very good training session with
Carol LaDelfe via e-mail.  Discussion of software Susana will need to perform
functions of the Membership Chair.  Susana had a question of how to
identify active and inactive members.  Suggestion made that she contact the
State Treasurer, Claudia Lewis.  Once Susana has an updated list of
members, she will begin to contact members who have not paid their dues.

* Report on State Board meeting:  Neither Angelique nor Margo attended the
State meeting.  Angelique said she was aware that judges are needed for the
State Science Fair, April 17th in Socorro.  Margo said she could possibly
be a judge.  Angelique and Margo agreed to be the LAWIS representatives at
the State Board meetings.

* Newsletter:  Tinka said she is almost done with the Newsletter.  Tinka
said it will include the list of new LAWIS board members, EYH memo, old
President's report.  Tinka asked anyone with old newsletters to give copies
to her.   Tinka is in the process of training Angelique to take over
newsletter duties.

* Tinka said she would like help in handling the noon-time talks.
Angelique and Ann volunteered to help.  Tinka asked people to contact her
and let her know talks for which they are available.

* Tinka asked how sub-server list could be created, for information that
just needs to go out to the Steering Committee.  Janie said she would
contact Tinka about creating a sub-server list.

* 10th Steering Committee member:  Sharon introduced Huyen N. Dinh, the
LAWIS 10th Steering Committee member.  Huyen was active in Women-in-Science
in Calgary.  Board members welcomed Huyen as a new member-at-large.  Board
members gave Huyen a description of the member-at-large position.

* Replacement for lunch talks coordinator:  Sharon has lunch talk speakers
confirmed through October 1999, with exception of September.  She suggested
that speakers be lined up about 3 - 4 months in advance, to assure
reservation of Otowi side rooms.  Sharon will be leaving Los Alamos in
September.  She said speakers have been very cooperative and willing to help.


* Bylaws clarification:  Margo said the bylaws committee has not met.  dede
is the chair.   Margo and one other person serve on the committee.  Margo
will call dede to get a meeting of the committee together.  Margo said her
most current bylaws are dated 1985 and that they need changes.

* Sponsorship of Kendra LeSar:  Tinka said Kendra LeSar is already
attending the Presidential classroom on science in Washington D.C.  She is
a Junior in  high school.  The committee agreed to send her a careers
booklet and invite her to speak for part of one of the lunch talks.  Tinka
volunteered to draft a letter to Kendra from the LAWIS Steering Committee.

* Science Fair report:  Tinka provided a report on the LA County Science
Fair.  Tinka said there were 176 entries, down from 250 last year.  Tinka
reported that almost
two-thirds of the entries were from female students.  Tinka said she would
send a letter to Otowi Station, thanking them for their support of the
Science Fair, and generous gifts.

(Tinka didn't write these down unfortunately as she forgot about the school
projects til the last minute and the paper only listed the ones above,
so if any of you know if one of these got a poster - or if one listed
didn't - Tinka would appreciate your letting her know. The person from the
schools is supposed to call her back when she gets back from travel, but
she suspects they may not have it either as it was added "on the fly"
during the awards ceremony...)

on request)

at the 1999 Los Alamos County Science Fair.
Los Alamos Women in Science hopes you continue
to develop your potential as a future scientist.
________________________________

The schools received only the posters as Tinka didn't remember them till the
last minute as was mentioned above.

The other awards winners received the paper certificate above, the gift
certificate from Otowi Station, and a "Trust me, I'm a Scientist" bumper
sticker. Note Otowi Station donated 2 of the $5 gift certificates (so Tinka
hurried back and added 2 more names of kids not otherwise getting awards
and gave 12 HM's instead of the 10 planned), and she donated the paper
certificates and the bumper stickers, and the AAPT donated the posters,
so LAWIS spent $100.

Judges for LAWIS:
Catherine A. French-Sidoti
Yi Jiang
Katherine Campbell
Tinka Gammel
Kathy Prestridge
Kim Thomas
Jennifer A. Macy
Janie Enter

* Margo said she had circulated a draft of the minutes she prepared from
the LAWIS annual meeting held in December 1998.  She said the majority of
committee members had approved the minutes.  Margo will send the final,
approved copy of the minutes out.

* EYH is going well, and is not hurting for money.  We  have 13-14
workshops confirmed, and are looking for a couple more (we would like to
have a minimum of 15).
  
* It was mentioned that we should work with the Bradbury Science Museum or
WDWG on women's history month (either this year or next) to incorporate
issues of "women of the Manhattan Project".  Since women's history month is
in March it is probably easier to plan this for next year. The other idea
was to use this for the laboratory's anniversary in June (they're always
looking for poster ideas).

* Agenda items for next meeting:
	Report from annual meeting committee
	Report from EYH
	Other reports
	New business

* we are looking for a hard copy of the bylaws after WIS became part of the
network as LAWIS.  Margo Clark, dede Collins and Nancy Sheer are the bylaws
committe.
 
* Next meeting will be March 10th at 7:15 am
  
* Adjourned at about 8:15 am.
