Nominating Committee Summary:
    Call for nominations is going slow. Two people are definites, 4 people said
    to ask again next year, and Susan's committee has several others in mind.  

    Nomination ballots need to be out to members no later than Oct 1st. (2 weeks
    before Annual Meeting). The ballots need to be back by 3 days before Annual
    Meeting to allow time to count ballots.

Jo received a letter from Kathleen Funk and Betty Strietelmeier (CST) about 
    a Group Leader position that is opening up. She would like it if the 
    LAWIS would get the word out to its membership. Lois will take the memo, 
    Xerox, put labels on, and mail out to the membership by Fri Sept. 9th. 
    Thanks Lois! It was suggested to send these two women applications to 
    join the LAWIS.

Treasurer '93 - '94 Account Audit:
    Lois will contact Mary Jo Lundy about possibly auditing our accounts in
    exchange for a LAWIS annual membership. She will contact Mary Jo as soon
    as she is able to get the books in order.

Discussion of the scholarship fund. Suggestion for next year: scholarship
    committee needed.

Susan will contact Alicia to let her know that we are giving her a LAWIS
    annual membership for her talk.

The next Steering Committee Meeting will be Wed. October 5th. We will not
