To:     LAWIS Steering Committee
From:   Kathryn Strong, HR T&D, Secretary
Re:     LAWIS Steering Committee Meeting Dec 1, 1994


The LAWIS steering committee met over the lunch hour Dec 1, 1994 in room
E228 in Otowi.  In attendance were Deborah Kubicek, Karen Paige, Denise
George, Kathryn Strong, Susan Roach, Shirley Herrera, Jo Irwin, and Wendee
Brunish.

There was some confusion about the meeting date due to last minute changes
caused by the lack of available rooms in Otowi Nov 30, 1994.  All future
steering meetings will target a week with Wednesday noon always first
choice; however, no final date will be given until the room is scheduled and
a reminder note is sent.  Our next meeting will be the week of Jan 9 with
Jan 11 our first option.

One correction from the Nov 1 minutes now reads that Lynda Towers
volunteered as first choice for the Workforce Resilience Team and Jo Irwin
is backup.

Following the agenda: first was a series of misc. items. 
    Those who attend the state board meetings can get reimbursement for
    mileage. 

    There is a future speaker list with recommendations on file with Kathryn
    Strong.  Anyone wishing to contribute to the list may do so.  Currently
    names are
    Carolina Yahne:     Psychological sex equity
    Candace Schau:      Issues of being female physicist
    Mary Dudley:        Fair treatment of workers (emphasis on 
                        women and children)
    Alicia Cuaron:      Impact of minority women in workforce
    Dorothy Hoard       Local hikes
    Lois Toeves         Women's health issues
    Additional topic ideas may include Dream Analysis, Networking and Dual
    Career Couples.

    LAWIS Steering Committee meeting notes will be on file on GOPHER for
    general reading.

    Trish will take care of filing the state corporation papers. 

    The committee voted to shred all personnel files for the reentry program
    including applications and interview notes.  Karen will oversee that
    project.

    The committee okayed $50 for food for the Christmas party Dec 7, 1994.
    It is at Deborah Kubicek's home at 995 Tsankawi.  The $1.00 charge will 
    be used for door prizes with any left over also going for food.  Food 
    from anyone else will also be welcome.

Next on the agenda were a series of reports:
    Treasurer: (Deborah giving it in absence of Trish Wright)
        The books have been handed over. An audit is still pending with 
        Mary Jo Lundy and Deborah Kubicek (Cindy Sievers and Wendee Brunish 
        are back-up). Currently we have $988.61 in checking, 552.64 in savings, 
        $501.37 in scholarship and $300 for EYH.  A check for an additional 
        $200 from the state is due along with $5.00 reimbursement for each 
        member from last year.  A budget will be proposed at our next meeting.
    Membership: (Denise George)
        Currently there are 36 paid members confirmed but Denise still has to
        coordinate with Trish and the State to finalize the list.  Overdue 
        notices will be sent in January along with recruitment notices.
    Newsletter: (Susan Roach)
        The first newsletter was sent November 22, 1994.  Due to the high 
        cost of postage, future newsletters will not be sent unless external 
        receivers have paid their dues.  Newsletters will be published 
        quarterly with extras developed as needed. 
    NMNWSE: (Jo Irwin)
        Jo confirmed financial issues which she must attend to at the next 
        State meeting: our obligation to send dues and application forms 
        and their obligation to give refund for last year members ($5.00 
        for each member) and to give a check for $200 for 1994 EYH. A check 
        for 1995 EYH for $300 has already been received.
    Diversity: (Kathryn Strong)
        Laboratory plans to move ahead have not been solidified although there 
        has been movement towards management training and an LLC Working Group.

New Calendar Dates
    Jan         Science Fair (Denise George will lead committee)
    Feb         Women's Health Talk (Susan Roach will look into speaker)
    May         Nature walk with Dorothy Hoard (Karen is organizing)
    June            Summer Picnic

    Unless there is a committed volunteer, the spring colloquium will not be
    done this year.

Time ran out before all issues on the agenda were discussed.
