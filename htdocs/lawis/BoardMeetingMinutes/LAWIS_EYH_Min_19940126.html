6.  Finance  (Roberta Day Idzorek)
    a. Budget
       Roberta took last years and reworked it
       A copy of the budget was sent around - many question marks
       WIS treasure has about $1000 in it

    b. Suggestions for T-shirts, buttons, etc.
       Karen will look into getting scientific gadgets/toys
       Shirley and Roberta will work on donations
       Lois will look into Protocol for money and/or give away items
       It is believed that the Network has rules regarding the amount WIS
         can give toward transportation. Last year we gave $90.
       We have 9 T-shirts remaining from last year. It was suggested that
         these be given away in a drawing for the girls.
       Denise will be in ABQ and will look at several places for give away
         items.
