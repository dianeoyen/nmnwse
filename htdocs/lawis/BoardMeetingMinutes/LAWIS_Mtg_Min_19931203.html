MINUTES WIS STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING OF December 3, 1993

Members of the steering committee met in room E-228 of the Ottowi Building.
Attending members were:
    Denise George
    Deborah Kubicek
    Karen Schultz Paige
    Leslie Swanson
    DeDe Collins from the NMNWSE

DeDe Collins talked to us about Expanding Your Horizons (EYH). She is in search
    for someone to chair (or even co-chair) the committee to organize this
    event. She will talk to Shirley (since she was signed up for this event)
    to see if she will co-chair with her. There was talk about some of the jobs 
    that need to be filled (organizing demos, publicity, solicit for donations, 
    set-up, etc.).  The board decided to spend its next board meeting on this 
    topic. It was decided to wait till after the Holidays to begin 
    organizing - too hectic for everyone before then. The meeting will be used
    as a joint call for volunteers for the EYH and Careers & Curiosities events.
    The notice for the meeting will be sent out the Monday we get back from 
    the Holidays.

Leslie reported that the Newsletter is well on its way. It should be ready for 
    distribution on Monday. Leslie will sent it to Denise who will photocopy it
    and either label them herself or send them to Karen to label.

The Holiday gathering will occur Wednesday December 15th from 4:30pm to 5:30pm
    in side room A of the Ottowi building. A notice will be put in the 
    Newsletter and fliers will be sent out. Denise has already put the notice
    out on the network. 
               
Deborah has decided to take over the task of getting the information needed 
    to put important information on the network for general viewing. The board
    thought to start out, we could put out the newsletter, our board meeting
    minutes, our By-laws, and a general category for general discussion. 
    Deborah will get the info, write it up, make sure it is distributed to
    all interested people, and be the contact/support person for these activities.
    In doing this we have removed the following agenda items (unless someone
    feels this does not sufficiently cover the topic): 
      * Brainstorm on subdirectories 
      * Keeping membership more informed about what the board is doing
      * Relaying gathered information:
        - network newsgroup
        - sub categories
        - way of letting people know what the WIS can offer (what can we offer?)

Next meeting will be Noon on Monday Jan. 10th. Karen will arrange the room 
    at send us all out notices. Denise will also send out notices to others
    possibly interested in discussing EYH.
