The surface expression of the tectonically active Pajarito fault system 
(PFS) ranges from simple normal faulting to complex zones of distributed 
faulting and monoclinal folding. The Pleistocene (1.22 Myr old) Tshirege 
Member of the Bandelier Tuff (Qbt) provides an exceptional datum for 
studies of the PFS's Quaternary evolution. As the fault system cuts Qbt 
nearly end to end along its 50 km length, we use it to construct a 
composite fault displacement profile. Throw measured on displaced contacts 
of Qbt subunits or on the displaced top of the tuff shows that the PFS 
consists of numerous sections (8-12 km long) that each exhibit their 
maximum throw near their midpoint with throw dying out toward their ends. 
The cumulative displacement profile describes an elliptical shape typical 
of an isolated fault although the profile is somewhat saw-toothed with 
prominent throw deficits at locations where the main Pajarito fault bends 
sharply. The style of deformation is particularly complex at these bends. 
Where slip is transferred from the N-striking Pajarito fault (PF) to the 
NE-striking Santa Clara Canyon fault (SCC), the PF forms a classic fault 
tip, where deformation is distributed across a broad zone of en echelon, 
small-displacement, synthetic and antithetic normal faults, fissures, and 
monoclinal folds. Short fault lengths and changes in sense of throw along 
strike are common. Two prominent antithetic faults relay slip to the SCC 
beyond the tip of the PF. Their maximum throw is greatest on the end 
closest to the PF, indicating fault interaction. Faults with opposing dips 
in the bend likely interlock, posing a geometrical barrier where ruptures 
either nucleate or terminate. That this portion of the PFS is strong fits 
with the slip deficit at this location and the paleoseismic event 
chronology, which demonstrates that the antithetic faults do not rupture 
every time the PF does. This bend in the fault system is also characterized 
by dilational normal faulting. Open, surficial fissures are common as are 
sediment-filled fissures, open framework breccias, and considerable fault 
plane topography in trench exposures of fault splays. These features are 
consistent with substantial dilation in the fault bend. This style of 
deformation enhances fluid flow and transport and must be factored into 
hydrogeologic investigations.  (<I>LA-UR-05-5275</I>)




<P> <I>Biography</I> -
Claudia Lewis works on seismic hazards in the vicinity of LANL,
fracture systems and fluid flow, and various projects in Spain. 
In addition to her scientific work, 
she was the founding President of the Board of the Pajarito Environmental Education Center
in Los Alamos, which serves as a resource for the interpretation
and stewardship of the natural history and environment of Los Alamos County
and the Jemez Mountains area.
