<P>
Wendee Brunish will report on the 25th anniversary conference on Women in Science and Engineering: Choices and Successes, sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences, which she recently attended.  Her previously announced talk, "Dogs and
Scent Detection", has been moved to later this summer, as Wendee felt there were several issues discussed at the conference that would be of interest to LAWIS members. Hope to see you all at both talks!</P>
<P>Sideroom C is reserved from 11:30 to 1:30 for people who like to eat earlier
or later, and informal discussion. You are welcome to come for just the talk at
noon.</P>
