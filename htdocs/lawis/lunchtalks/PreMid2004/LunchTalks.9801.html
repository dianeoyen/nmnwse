Kicking off the LAWIS Lunch-Time Talks for 1998 will be Laura Kraemer
speaking on her experiences serving in AmeriCorps. Laura will give an
overview of the program she was in, National Civilian Community Corps,
as well as mentioning other programs under the AmeriCorps umbrella.
I'm looking forward to another year of interesting and fun talks!

Sideroom C is reserved from 11:30 to 1:30 for people who wish to eat
earlier or later, and informal discussion.



       ------------  OTHER LAWIS ANNOUNCEMENTS ------------

1) The kickoff planning meeting for the Expanding Your Horizons Workshop
for 8-10 grade girls in Northern NM is scheduled for 11:30-1:00 tomorrow
(Wednesday, January 7), in the E228 Conference Room in the Otowi bldg
at LANL (beneath the cafeteria). Please attend the meeting or contact
Joyce Guzik (joy@lanl.gov, 7-8927) or Alexine Salazar (alexine@lanl.gov,
7-1785) if you are interested in helping: everything from workshop presenters
to fund raisers to "go-fers" are needed. This is a very rewarding experience!

2) Volunteers are needed February 6 and 7 to judge for the LAWIS awards
for best projects by female students at the 1998 Los Alamos County Science
Fair. Last year we awarded a total of about $50 to the three projects,
plus 10 Honorable Mentions, focusing on elementary school students.
This is an easy way to serve the community --  and it is fun to meet
young people excited by learning about how things work! Contact Joyce
Guzik (joy@lanl.gov, 7-8927) before Jan. 19 if you are interested
in judging, or would like more information.

3) The second LAWIS lunch talk of 1998 is scheduled for Thursday, Feb. 12,
when Ann Pendergrass of ESH-3, LANL, has agreed to speak on her work.
Any volunteers to speak in March??
