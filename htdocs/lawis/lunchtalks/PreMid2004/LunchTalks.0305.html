NMNWSE board members, the past LAWIS board, and anyone interested in serving on a future LAWIS board are strongly encouraged to participate in this discussion. Current suggestions are:
<UL><LI> have the past officers continue in their current positions until elections can be held, appointing a nominating committee ASAP, <B>OR</B> </LI><LI> 
use the state board as the LAWIS board, with the state board then responsible for deciding the future of LAWIS.

Leadership coaching is a customized, confidential, 
one-on-one process designed to help leaders and managers develop effective 
responses to their most important workplace challenges.   At this talk, I 
will cover more about what leadership coaching is; why leaders and managers 
use coaches; and how the coaching process works.  I am also looking for 
volunteers, people in leadership or management roles who want to experience 
the benefits of coaching.

<P><I>Biography</I>: &nbsp; Amy Anderson is a counselor and coach in the HSR-2 Employee Assistance 
Program.  She has 20 years of experience in the field of mental health.  In 
addition to her work as a counselor, Amy gives presentations on a number of

biofeedback.  She is a licensed mental health counselor in the state of New

<P>
NW-SC Memorial Conference Room, Room 226, Bldg 1, Los Alamos Research Park,
4200 West Jemez Road (<a href="/home/lawis/Maps/ResPrk.jpg">click here for map with Bldg 1 at the Research Park highlighted</A>). Room 226 is on the second floor near the <a href="http://www.hotrocksjava.com">Hot Rocks Java Cafe</a> &nbsp; (I did not try phoning in an order, but I found the quality and time needed to get your food compared favorably to the LANL cafeteria). From the elevator: get off elevator at 2nd floor, turn right and enter room 200, then go
right (following the "LANL computer classrooms" sign) and bear right
again at the front desk (towards the sign "Encantado Classroom"), then
left and down the hall to the NW-SC memorial conf rm (rm 226) at the end
of the hall. This is LANL space so wear your badge, and sign in (and out) on the book just outside rm 226.
If you don't have a badge and would like to come, please contact me (jtg@lanl.gov, 7-9149) ASAP.
