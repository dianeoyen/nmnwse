<P>
The study of surface adsorbate effects on platinum nanoparticles is important
 for improving platinum's favorable catalytic activity in direct methanol fuel
 cells. Platinum nanopartilces are very potent electrocatalysts for methanol 
electrooxidation, especially when modified with various transition metals. The 
reason for observed enhancements in activity by the incorporation of various 
metals with Pt is not well understood. The combination of electrochemistry and NMR 
provides a facile means of modifying and monitoring electronic alterations. The 
NMR technique is not limited to just one side of the interface; by probing select
 nuclei both the Pt substrate and specific surface adsorbates may be investigated.
 195Pt and 13C have been shown to be powerful microscopic probes of the 
electrochemical 
solid/liquid interface of Pt nanoparticles modified by various adsorbates, 
through the determination of the Fermi-level local density of states (EF-LDOS). 
 NMR has been used to investigate phenomena such as the strong-metal-support
-interaction, for carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles, the results are also supported 
by in-situ FTIR studies. Increases in methanol electrooxidation activity for
 ruthenium modified Pt nanoparticles have been correlated to changes in Pt's 
EF-LDOS, showing a weakening of the Pt-CO bond. The obtained catalytic activity has
 been found to be proportional to the percentage of metallic Ru.

<P>Sideroom C is reserved from 11:30 to 1:30 for people who 
like to eat earlier or later, and informal discussion. You are
welcome to come for just the talk at noon, and questions are encouraged!</P>

<H1> <FONT COLOR="green"><B>LAWIS PICNIC and ANNUAL MEETING Tuesday, SEPT 19</B></FONT></H1>

<P>
We have had a rough go at this year, especially those who lost
homes in the fire.  If I'm a "typical" sample, I'm sure the rest of you
have also agonized through stresses caused by the fire and the 
many security issues haunting the Lab.  As everyone's infamous
mother has said, "This, too, shall pass."

<P>
We are not alone and we have not forgotten our many other duties and
responsibilities.  Albeit somewhat late, we are preparing for a late
summer picnic.  We have scheduled Urban Park on September 19
from 11:30 - 1:30 to get together and share in a meal, conversation,
friendship, stories, and even a short meeting.  The meal will be a
salad potluck which means bring your favorite salad dish to share.
The committee will provide plates/napkins/forks/spoons and a variety of drinks.
Quite possibly even some entertainment!

<P>
We also wish to extend an invitation to non-members wanting to know more
about LAWIS.  Family members are most certainly invited as well, especially
our significant others who allow us the time and energy to participate in our many
volunteer jobs.  Most of our summer students have returned to school but
for the few remaining, please come and bring your mentor(s) ... or vice versa.

<P>
As mentioned above, we will be having a short meeting, mainly for the purpose of
voting on the revised By-Laws.  Our fiscal year has been aligned with the state 
organization's year which begins October 1.  Thus, the Committee felt we 
needed to vote on our revised By Laws and begin our new fiscal year with a
"clean slate".

<P>
We hope to see each of you there.  Here's hoping for sunshine!!!!
