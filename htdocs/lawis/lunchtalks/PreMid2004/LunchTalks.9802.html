<P> Teralene Foxx will discuss the Laboratory as a natural refuge, and the
environmental studies related to the biota which she has been involved
in over the past years.  She will relate how she believes understanding
the natural environment is important to the Laboratory's programs.
This should be a very interesting talk! I hope to see you there! </P>

<P>IF YOU SENT BACK THE "PRELIMINARY INTEREST" FORM
(OR ARE NOT INTERESTED)
YOU DO NOT NEED TO SEND THIS FORM BACK</P>
<P>If you think you might join us, please return by ** March 13 **
to me (Tinka Gammel, jtg@lanl.gov, MS B221, 7-9149, Fax 5-5757,
email preferred)</P>
<P>(Note for late repliers - I am on travel Mar 16-20, so try and get it
to me by the above "deadline"; but if you can't the deadline is "ASAP".)</P>
<P>You do not need to be a LAWIS member to come.  Children under 18 may
not "go underground" at WIPP (their regulation; about 1 hour of the 4
hour tour), but otherwise are welcome.</P>
<P>By popular vote, we will stay in a cheap hotel rather than try and camp.</P>
<P>Re when to go down and when to return:<BR>
there was enough interest expressed that I am thinking that even if we
carpool we can probably have a few groups going down/returning at
different times to accommodate different schedules/interests. So check
your favorite times and I'll try and coordinate this.</P>

<P><H1>Sign-Up Sheet for All-Day Field Trip; Thu, Apr. 16</H1></P>
<P>AM: Jemez Geology Field Trip;<BR>
PM: Milagro Gamma Ray Burst Observatory</P>
<P>Carol Hogsett, GRA Representative at LANL and geologist by training
(you may remember the excellent talk she gave to LAWIS last fall),
will be conducting a tour to the Jemez and the Milagro Gamma Ray Burst
Observatory on April 16th for several SERS/URS students here at LANL.
She has graciously volunteered to make this a LAWIS event as well.
You do not need to be a LAWIS member to come.</P>
<P>The field trip will last all day, and we will need to carpool
since parking a bunch of cars along the road at the various stops
can be tricky.</P>
<P>Please send me (Tinka Gammel, jtg@lanl.gov, 7-9149) the following
info by April 7 if you would like to join this field trip:<BR>
Apr. 16 LAWIS Field Trip Sign-Up<BR><BR>
Name:__________________________<BR>
Telephone:_____________________<BR>
Email:_________________________<BR><BR>
I do not know if it is possible to join for only 1/2 the trip,
but let me know if this would work better for you<BR>
(and which 1/2:   ___ AM/Jemez       ___ PM/Milagro ).</P>
<P> There is no limit to the number of people.
All participants should bring a lunch and water.
Depart 8AM, probably from Study Center (to be determined
when we make carpooling arrangements).</P>
<P>If you can't make it this time, but might like to go on either
or both 1/2's of this trip at a later date, let me know:
Carol is willing to lead another trip later this summer
if there is interest.</P>
