We have had a rough go at this year, especially those who lost
homes in the fire.  If I'm a "typical" sample, I'm sure the rest of you
have also agonized through stresses caused by the fire and the 
many security issues haunting the Lab.  As everyone's infamous
mother has said, "This, too, shall pass."

<P>
We are not alone and we have not forgotten our many other duties and
responsibilities.  Albeit somewhat late, we are preparing for a late
summer picnic.  We have scheduled Urban Park on September 19
from 11:30 - 1:30 to get together and share in a meal, conversation,
friendship, stories, and even a short meeting.  The meal will be a
salad potluck which means bring your favorite salad dish to share.
The committee will provide plates/napkins/forks/spoons and a variety of drinks.
Quite possibly even some entertainment!

<P>Urban Park is located off Urban St. between 42nd St. and 44th St. in the &quot;North Community&quot; area of Los Alamos. <a href="/home/lawis/Pretty/urban_park.gif">(click for map)</a>

<P>
We also wish to extend an invitation to non-members wanting to know more
about LAWIS.  Family members are most certainly invited as well, especially
our significant others who allow us the time and energy to participate in our many
volunteer jobs.  Most of our summer students have returned to school but
for the few remaining, please come and bring your mentor(s) ... or vice versa.

<P>
As mentioned above, we will be having a short meeting, mainly for the purpose of
voting on the revised By-Laws.  Our fiscal year has been aligned with the state 
organization's year which begins October 1.  Thus, the Committee felt we 
needed to vote on our revised By Laws and begin our new fiscal year with a
"clean slate".

<P>
We hope to see each of you there.  Here's hoping for sunshine!!!!
