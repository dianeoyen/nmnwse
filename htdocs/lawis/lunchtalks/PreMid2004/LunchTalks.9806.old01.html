<P> 
Jeanne is one of the people responsible for the bird-houses with the
"environmental monitoring station" signs you may have noticed on many
of the local trails, and she will be speaking about what she has
learned so far from this study.  I am looking forward to learning
about this important work, and hope to see you there!
</P>
<P>
The talk will be preceeded by a brief LAWIS board meeting at 11:30. 
This is an open meeting and you are welcome to come and give your 
input and ideas for future LAWIS activities. The "most important" 
topic will be deciding when to hold the LAWIS annual picnic!
</P>
<P>Sideroom A is reserved from 11:30 to 1:30 for people who 
like to eat earlier or later, and informal discussion. You are
welcome to come for just the talk at noon.</P>
