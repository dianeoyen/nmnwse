<P>
At Pahute Mesa on the Nevada Test Site, a small amount of plutonium was recently detected 
1.3 km from its source, the BENHAM underground nuclear test. This observation is critical 
because it illustrates a gap in our current understanding of the mobility of plutonium in groundwater, 
previously considered immobile because of its chemical properties. The
plutonium was found in two aquifers, a lava formation at about the same elevation as the 
detonation point and a welded tuff formation 600 m above the detonation point, 
separated by a low permeability zeolitized tuff. In both locations, the
plutonium was associated with colloid particles, particles 50 to 500 uM in size. 
To study and understand the conditions that
led to this colloid-facilitated transport of plutonium, we have developed a 
modeling strategy that consists of the subregional
groundwater flow system and reactive transport processes associated with fractured 
rock. We are developing a 
subregional-scale (8 km by 10.4 km) flow model to investigate the influence of 
complex geologic features and hydrologic
parameters on the magnitude and direction of ground water flow through the areas 
between the BENHAM source and wells
in which plutonium was observed. Within the subregional-scale domain, we have 
embedded a site-scale(2.6 km by 3.2 km)
domain containing the BEHNAM test area and the observation site, where the spatial 
distribution of hydrogeologic
properties such as permeability and porosity can be varied at the 50 m scale. This 
high resolution domain helps us to
evaluate the impact of spatial variability in the transport models. Further, at an 
even finer scale near the source, we are
evaluating thermal convective transport as the major mechanism for the movement of 
plutonium up and out of the nuclear
test chimney/cavity system into the two separate aquifers. This mechanism is critical 
for explaining how plutonium was
found above a low permeability tuff aquitard. Once the plutonium has reached the 
welded tuff and the lava aquifers,
chemical modeling of diffusion, sorption and plutonium-colloid interactions are 
considered. We are integrating all of these
components into a total system analysis tool for future risk assessment by the 
DOE and the state of Nevada.
