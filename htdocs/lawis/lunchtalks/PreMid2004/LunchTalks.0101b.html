<P>
In the search for improvement of educational opportunities, 
well-meaning individuals and groups often seek to implement changes 
in local school districts.  Some current and recent examples of 
topics that have been discussed and/or implemented in the Los Alamos 
Public School District include year-round-schools, changes in the 
mathematics curriculum, common planning time, block scheduling, 
grade centers, and homework clubs.

<P>
Before implementing such changes, it is important that these issues 
be examined carefully
for their impact on students, families, teachers, administrators, 
and the community at
large.  While both anecdotal and quantitative evidence from other 
communities is often interesting and may help identify issues that 
need to be considered, this type of information
may not be directly applicable to the local population.

<P>
In this seminar, statistical reasoning tools will be introduced to 
facilitate scientific evaluation of educational issues.  The focus 
will be primarily on simple, structured thinking processes and 
awareness of assumptions required to support the use of more 
sophisticated statistical survey and test methods.


<P>
Joanne Wendelberger has a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and 
Economics from Oberlin College and Masters and Ph.D. degrees in 
Statistics from the University of Wisconsin.  She has worked as a 
statistical consultant to the General Motors Research Laboratories and
is currently a staff member in the Statistical Sciences Group at Los 
Alamos National Laboratory.  Dr. Wendelberger's experience in the 
educational field includes serving as a
math and science instructor in the Upward Bound Program for minority 
and low-income high school students, as a college-level teaching 
assistant in remedial mathematics, and as a former board member and 
president of Little Forest Playschool.  Dr. Wendelberger has 3 
children, ages 12, 8, and 6, and is active in her local community as 
a classroom helper, girl scout co-leader, soccer coach, and 
gymnastics school parent volunteer.
