<P>
Students,<br>
There is still space available in next weeks panel discussion,
&quot;Career Paths for Women in the Sciences and Science-Related
Fields.&quot; There will be a panel of women available to talk about
their student to staff experiences. If you are not pursuing a degree in
the sciences you are still encouraged and welcome to attend. This will be
a great opportunity to meet other students, as well as, get some guidance
from some very successful and interesting women. Please let me know if
you are interested in attending. If we have a good response with this
initial event we will continue the same format with different panelists
and topics.<br>
I hope you will join us!<br>
