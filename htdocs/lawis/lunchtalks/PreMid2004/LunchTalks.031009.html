<P>
This talk is a brief overview of climate change today.
It in no way covers every topic, but rather highlights issues that fall under the media buzzword "global warming". Among the topics covered will be "contrails" (condensation trails from jet airplanes) and cloud formation, deforestation and greenhouse gasses, and whale hunting and algae blooms -- emphasizing how man's activities affect the natural mechanisms which determine climatic balance.  After learning about climate change you will no longer feel it is silly to "just talk
about the weather": it is certainly one of the most important current topics for people all over the world.

<P><I>Biography</I>: &nbsp; Dr. Marsh has worked since 1981 in the Old and New World tropics doing research and education programs.
She has studied several species of primates in the wild and captivity, as well as many other species such as
plants, butterflies, harriers, cheetahs, bats, and jaguars. Her dissertation fieldwork was conducted in Belize on
the Central American black howler monkey and tropical forest fragmentation. She currently works as a
technical staff member in the Ecology Group for Los Alamos National Laboratory, as a Wetlands Specialist, the
chair of the Wetlands Working Group, and chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. She is the
Outreach chair for her group as well as the Student Coordinator. In addition, she worked for 3 years as the
Science Programs Specialist for the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)
Education Program. She continues to conduct workshops for teachers and communities in situ, and developed
educational materials for the North Slope of Alaska (Barrow, Atqasuk), Tropical Western Pacific (Papua New
Guniea, Republic of Nauru), and Southern Great Plains (Oklahoma, Kansas). She recently edited and wrote a
volume called, "Primates in Fragments: Ecology and Conservation" published this year by Klewer/Plenum
Scientific. In her spare time she writes stories for children.

<P> &nbsp;<br>
Use of the conference room was donated by the <a href="http://la-rp.org/synergy.html">Synergy Center</a>, an "economic development incubator" located in the <a href="http://la-rp.org/Home.html">Los Alamos Research Park</a> with the goal of promoting development
of R&amp;D and technology business activities. Contact Monica McCoy at 661-4807 for more information on the Synergy Center.

<P><center><font color="green" size=+1><B>You need a parking pass to park at the Research Park!</B></font>
</center>
<P>
To get a parking permit in advance, you need to email or call Aurelia
Sisneros, <a href="mailto:aurelia@losalamos.org">aurelia@losalamos.org</a>,
663-5001, to get a numbered copy for yourself.
To get a parking permit when you arrive for the LunchTalk, park in the (15 minute?)
parking area just in front of the door to the Research Park
building, run up to the 3rd floor where Aurelia (at the front desk in
Synergy Center) or I will have permits available, then go back to your
car and park it in a longer term spot, and return to the 3rd floor for
the LunchTalk. Apologies for the inconvenience - the Research Park is
working on improving the procedure to facilitate parking for legitimate
purposes while still protecting it's parking from "LANL overflow".
