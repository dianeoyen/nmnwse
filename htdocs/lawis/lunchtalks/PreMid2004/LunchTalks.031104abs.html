<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><font size=+0>Real Time Radiography (RTR)
is one of the most important techniques of nondestructive assay used for
many years at the Laboratory, and at many other places. It is an active
imaging technique, applying an X-ray beam, adjustable in both power and
wavelength. The RTR hardware is relatively simple, robust and inexpensive,
commercially produced. It works both indoor and outdoor, in any weather
and temperature conditions acceptable for its human operators.</font>

<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><font size=+0>We propose to write software,
which would greatly extend applicability of RTR systems.</font>
<div STYLE="font-weight: medium"><font size=+0>Software requirements:</font></div>

<ul>
<li STYLE="font-weight: medium">
<font size=+0>Significant quality improvement of the X-ray images.</font></li>

<li STYLE="font-weight: medium">
<font size=+0>Easy identification of prohibited objects, even from partial
images.</font></li>

<li STYLE="font-weight: medium">
<font size=+0>Detection of Lead, Uranium, Transuranic Materials.</font></li>

<li STYLE="font-weight: medium">
<font size=+0>It will be tested for detection of transuranic materials
hidden inside lead blocks.</font></li>

<li STYLE="font-weight: medium">
<font size=+0>Easy to use by RTR operators.</font></li>

<li STYLE="font-weight: medium">
<font size=+0>Expanded software for professional off-line users.</font></li>
</ul>

<div STYLE="font-weight: medium"><font size=+0>The RTR system consists
of a rotating table, on which drums/cargo pieces are placed; a movable
and adjustable cone X-ray beam; a camera, recording image of a rotated
drum; a controlling monitor, on which real-time image from the camera is
visible; video recording of this image. Collimator crystal limits the diameter
of the X-beam. Due to this fact only projection of a small part of the
piece of cargo is usually visible at any single picture. Additionally,
objects inside a container frequently occlude each other. Identification
of an object, when only a part of the object is visible is currently one
of the most difficult tasks. Nonparallel projection and low image quality
are the other difficulties.</font></div>


<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><font size=+0>This project concerns analysis
of digitized images from RTR. Two versions of the program for image enhancement,
objects and materials detection are proposed. Highly automatized version
is designed for real-time use by RTR operators. An extended version of
the same program would be addressed to professional staff, for work off-line
with difficult RTR tapes.</font>

<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><font size=+0>The main tasks performed by
the proposed program: image enhancement; concatenation of individual pictures
to provide images of big objects; fitting virtual models of prohibited
items from a special library to their real-life counterparts by proper
rotation and scaling; recognition of X-ray absorbing materials. It is relatively
easy to differentiate X-ray pictures of lead and uranium/transuranic materials
from all other materials. Proper tuning of software to parameters of a
particular X-ray beam would provide possibility to differentiate between
lead and all heavier than lead materials. Tests will be performed to establish
how clearly this system would identify uranium/transuranic materials hidden
inside lead bricks. Nuclear materials, which are heavily lead-shielded
do not produce detectable radiological signals. It makes such materials
practically unrecognizable for any passive measurement. RTR technique is
an active technique based on differences in X-ray absorption. It allows
finding such materials in cases that their intrinsic radiation is fully
shielded. We propose the test measurements on lead shielded depleted uranium.
The choice of such materials would not change the test results; it is driven
by ALARA, but is also cost effective and advisable due to security.</font>

<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><font size=+0>Real Time Radiography (RTR)
system is used at LANL for characterization of transuranic and/or chemically
hazardous waste before their disposal. When RTR is insufficient to exclude
presence of a prohibited item inside a drum, such drum has to be manually
opened, examined and repacked. Opening a drum is costly and it causes radiation
exposure to the workers. In many cases (up to 50% of openings) the operation
is performed unnecessarily, due to insufficient data from RTR images. Digital
methods of image enhancement and object identification would significantly
reduce the percentage of unnecessarily opened drums. It would effectively
save LANL opening of thousands of drums during the next few years.</font>

<p STYLE="font-weight: medium"><font size=+0>It is a new project, but one
of the investigators (HM), has extensive experience with RTR images interpretation
at TRU waste characterization project, where for 3 years she was responsible
for reconciliation of RTR results with the waste generators data. LANL
has highly trained technicians who are the leading experts in performing
RTR, and working RTR systems. It would be easy and cost effective to perform
software tests on test packages at LANL. The developed software would have
numerous potential applications in border security; air cargo security;
nuclear waste characterization at LANL as well as other sites, which posses
nuclear waste. Proposed test is nondestructive, fast, RTR system is very
robust, working in practically any indoor and outdoor conditions, relatively
inexpensive, may be performed by moderately trained operators, safe for
humans and environment.</font>
