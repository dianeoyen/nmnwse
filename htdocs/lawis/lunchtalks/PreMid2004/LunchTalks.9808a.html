Massive Exploding Stars:
The Variability and Outbursts of<br> Luminous Blue Variable Stars
</FONT></CENTER>
</td></tr> </table></center>

<P> 
Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are extremely massive stars, from 30 to more than
100 times the mass of the sun.  They exhibit different kinds of variability
over timescales ranging from days to centuries.  Some of these stars, such
as the famous LBV Eta Carinae, have undergone giant eruptions, during which
they have increased dramatically in brightness, and ejected several solar
masses of material.  Joyce will describe the properties and behavior of these
stars, and discuss theoretical/computational research done at Los Alamos to
explain the causes of the mysterious variability and outbursts.
This is a general talk, and questions are encouraged.
</P>

<P>Sideroom C is reserved from 11:30 to 1:30 for people who 
like to eat earlier or later, and informal discussion. You are
welcome to come for just the talk at noon.
There will be a brief meeting of the LAWIS steering comittee
following the talk. NMNWSE-EYH/Quilt Raffle tickets will be available.
