Sign-Up Sheet for All-Day Field Trip; Thu, Apr. 16
--------------------------------------------------

AM: Jemez Geology Field Trip;                      
PM: Milagro Gamma Ray Burst Observatory
 
Carol Hogsett, GRA Representative at LANL and geologist by training
(you may remember the excellent talk she gave to LAWIS last fall),
will be conducting a tour to the Jemez and the Milagro Gamma Ray Burst
Observatory on April 16th for several SERS/URS students here at LANL.
She has graciously volunteered to make this a LAWIS event as well.
You do not need to be a LAWIS member to come.
 
The field trip will last all day, but it is possible to join for only
the morning or afternoon 1/2.  We will need to carpool since parking a
bunch of cars along the road at the various stops can be tricky.
 
Please send me (Tinka Gammel, jtg@lanl.gov, 7-9149) the following
info by April 7 if you would like to join this field trip:

There is no limit to the number of people.  All full-day participants
should bring a lunch, and everyone should bring water.
The trip departs at 8AM from Study Center.
If you are joining for the second half only, I will contact you to let
you know where to meet us.

If you can't make it this time, but might like to go on either
or both 1/2's of this trip at a later date, let me know:
Carol is willing to lead another trip later this summer
if there is interest.
