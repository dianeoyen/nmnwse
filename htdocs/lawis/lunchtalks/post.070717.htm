The detection of mid-wavelength infrared radiation (MWIR) is very
important for many military, industrial and biomedical applications.
Present-day commercially available uncooled IR sensors operating in MWIR
region (2-5 &micro;m) use microbolometric detectors which are inherently slow.
Available photon detectors (mercury cadmium telluride (MCT), bulk InSb
and quantum well infrared detectors (QWIPs)) overcome this limitation.
However, there are some fundamental issues decreasing their performance
and ability for high temperature operation, including fast Auger
recombination rates and high thermal generation rate. These detectors
operate at low temperatures (77K-200K) in order to obtain high signal to
noise ratio. The requirement of cooling limits the lifetime, increases
the weight and the total cost, as well as the power budget, of the whole
infrared system. In recent years, InAs/GaSb superlattice based
detectors have appeared as an interesting alternative to the present-day
IR detector systems.

<P>
These heterostructures have a type-II band alignment such that the
conduction band of the InAs layer is lower than the valence band of the GaSb
layer. The effective bandgap of these structures can be adjusted from
0.4 eV to values below 0.1 eV by varying the thickness of constituent
layers leading to an enormous range of detector cutoff wavelengths
(3-30 &micro;m). The InAs/GaSb superlattices have a higher degree of uniformity
than the MCT alloys, making them attractive for large area focal plane
arrays. They provide a smaller leakage current due to larger effective
electron mass, which suppresses tunneling. This material system is also
characterized by high operating temperatures and long Auger
recombination rates. This suggests the potential for using the superlattice
technology for realizing high operating temperature devices.

<P>
The thesis research summarized in this talk focused on the development
of mid-IR InAs/GaSb superlattice sensors
with high-operating temperature. Contributions from this research include 1)
development of growth and processing procedure for the n-on-p and p-on-n
design of superlattice detectors leading to improved detector performance, 2)
careful evaluation of characteristics of superlattice detectors, and 3) methods of
reduction of surface component of dark current (passivation techniques).

original abstract 

Present-day commercially available IR detectors operating in mid-wavelength
infrared region (MWIR) region (2-5 um) are mercury cadmium telluride (MCT)
and bulk InSb photon detectors. These detectors operate at cryogenic
temperatures (77K-120K) in order to obtain high signal to noise ratio.
The requirement of cooling limits the lifetime, increases the weight
and the total cost, as well as the power budget to operate such detectors. 
In recent years InAs/GaSb superlattice based detectors appeared as an
interesting alternative to the present-day IR detector systems. 
The InAs/GaSb superlattices have a higher degree of uniformity than the MCT alloys,
making them attractive for large area focal plane arrays. They provide
smaller leakage currents due to larger effective electron mass which suppresses
tunneling. This material system is also characterized by high operation
temperatures and longer Auger recombination rates. This suggests the potential
for using the superlattice technology for realizing high operating temperature devices.

Questions of growth, processing and characterization of mid- infrared (IR) InAs/GaSb superlattice sensors will be discussed in this presentation.
