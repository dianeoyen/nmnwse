(<I>LA-UR-05-6647</I>) &nbsp;
Preparing astronauts for the Red Planet is supposed to be a research priority for the International Space Station.  But NASA has numerous woes, including an ailing Space Shuttle system.  Today's skeleton
crew running the station will not be able to complete all of the research currently thought necessary to make a human trip to Mars absolutely safe.  What are some of the interesting research issues and options for getting a human crew to Mars?
<P>
Issues that will be discussed in this talk include:
<br>  &nbsp; <img src="http://nmnwse.org/lawis/Images/gr_dot.gif" width="10" >
For ambitious missions such as a human trip to Mars, the consequences of human-technology interactions become more profound and the expectations for crew task performance increase.
<br> &nbsp; <img src="http://nmnwse.org/lawis/Images/gr_dot.gif" width="10" >
For these long-term missions, a greater emphasis will need to be placed on the roles of crew compatibility and team performance in overall mission success.  
<!--
Analogue environments and behavioral challenges to evaluate individual and team performance are some approaches that will be discussed in the context of the research necessary to develop effective countermeasures for behavioral health risks of extended flight.  
-->
<br> &nbsp; <img src="http://nmnwse.org/lawis/Images/gr_dot.gif" width="10" >
Exposure to ionizing radiation from the solar wind, solar particle events, galactic cosmic rays and other sources is a major concern for space flight beyond low Earth orbit.  
<!--
Major developments in both biological research and shielding technology will be necessary to assure crew health and safety for a Martian mission, where higher radiation exposures can be expected.
-->
<br> &nbsp; <img src="http://nmnwse.org/lawis/Images/gr_dot.gif" width="10" >
Engineering challenges abound for a 30 month Mars mission, the transit portions of which will mean long-term microgravity for astronauts.
<!--
Life support equipment that functions in microgravity for prolonged periods will need to be designed and tested, medical procedures that can be performed in a microgravity environment need to be created, and life support systems which require no resupply must be designed and built.

<I>Biography</I> -- 
Elizabeth (Betsy) Cantwell is the Deputy Division Leader for Science and Technology in the International, Space and Response Division at LANL. 
<!--
Until June, she served as the Section Leader for the Micro and Nanotechnology Center, Lawrence Livermore's engineering research center for fabricating small sensors and devices.   She earned an undergraduate degree in psychology from the University of Chicago, and an M.S. and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley.  She also holds an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.    
<P>
-->
Dr. Cantwell began her career building life support systems for manned space missions with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and retains a consulting role as an advisor to NASA's
R&amp;D and risk portfolios pursuant to the President's new Exploration Missions back to the Moon and on to Mars.  She will bring this perspective to her talk about research issues for sending a human crew to Mars.
