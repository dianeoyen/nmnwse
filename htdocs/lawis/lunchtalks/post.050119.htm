<P>
Dogs can be trained to locate, identify, and alert on a
number of sources, including live humans, drugs,
and explosives.

<! P >
In the search and rescue world, dogs are increasingly being
used to locate human remains (known as human remains
detection or HRD).  This can range from a whole body (e.g., a
deceased hiker in the wilderness) to tiny amounts of human
flesh, fluids, teeth or bone (e.g., forensic evidence at a murder scene).

<! P>
For HRD, as for explosive and drug detection, dogs have several
significant advantages over man-made detection devices.  These
advantages include the ability to localize, the ability to discount
large background sources, and the ability to discriminate between
similar scent sources.  An additional advantage of dogs over
machines is the ability to practice "intelligent disobedience", i.e.,
looking where the "operator" has told the dog not to look.

<! P>
I will discuss the attributes of a good search dog, the training of
a search dog, and the specific training for an HRD dog.  My search
dog Halley and I will demonstrate some of the abilities described above,
including localization, large background, and scent discrimination.

<P><I>Biography:</I> &nbsp;
Wendee Brunish is a dog handler
with 16 years experience working with government
and law enforcement agencies. She is also a Team Leader in the
Geophysics Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory working on
issues related to underground nuclear test readiness, and a long time
LAWIS member.  <br> Halley is a six-year-old golden retriever/labrador retriever mix.
Both of her parents had successful careers as search dogs.  Her
mother Mona is credited with the only water cadaver find in New
Mexico.  Halley is certified for both wilderness air scent search
and for cadaver search.  She has participated in many searches
over the past 5 and half years, including a search on Laguna
Pueblo where she and her litter mate Sizzle helped redirect the
law enforcement effort by finding and identifying burnt human
remains.
