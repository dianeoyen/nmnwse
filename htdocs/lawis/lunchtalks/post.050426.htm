<P>
A large number of problems key to stockpile stewardship and 
homeland defense rely on
knowledge of nuclear physics in regimes inaccessible to experiment.
In nuclear explosions
unstable nuclei and nuclear isomers are produced in copious quantities 
and are used to diagnose the
explosion. Similarly, analysis of the unstable nuclei from the debris 
will be key to attribution in the event of
a terrorist domestic nuclear attack. 
In the case of nuclear non-proliferation a number of new schemes are
being considered by the IAEA to address the ever greater needs, including neutrino monitoring of the
plutonium content of reactors. 
For all of these problems detailed nuclear physics is required. In this talk I
discuss the nuclear physics needs for the type of problems of 
interest 
national security.  LA-UR-04-4775.

<I>Biography</I> -- 
Anna Hayes is a staff member in the Theoretical Division
at Los Alamos National Laboratory. She received her undergraduate education at
Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. 
In 1980 she moved to the U.S. for graduate school and received her Ph.D from
Yale University in 1986. After graduating from Yale she held postdoctoral
positions at University of
Minnesota and at Los Alamos National Lab. 
In 1991 she became a staff member in theoretical physic at  
at Chalk River Labs in Canada, where her research interests focused
mainly on nuclear structure and weak interaction in nuclei. 
In 1997 she returned to  Los Alamos and jointed T-division as a staff member in 
nuclear theory. Since joining
Los Alamos her research interests have broadened to 
include the application of
nuclear physics to threat reduction and national security.
She was elected a fellow of the
American Physical Society in 2002 and serves on the executive committee
of the division 
of nuclear physics.
