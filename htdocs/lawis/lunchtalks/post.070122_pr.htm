<FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="brown"><B>LAWIS to host Jan 22 talk on Sumatra Earthquake and Tsunami</B>
</font>
</center>

<P>
The December 2004 Sumatra earthquake was a momentous event, whether
measured by scientific or human standards. Sadly, what is currently
regarded as the 3rd largest earthquake in recorded history led to the
worst tsunami disaster in recorded history, with the loss of over
200,000 lives and ocean-wide devastation.

<P>
In January, the Los Alamos Women in Science (LAWIS) Seminar Series will
feature Prof. Susan Bilek of New Mexico Tech speaking on the sobering
scientific lessons learned from this global-scale disaster, and how it
relates to past and future earthquakes in the western United States. The
talk will be at 12:00 noon on Monday, 22 Jan. 2007, in the main Lecture
Hall in Building 2 on the UNM-LA Campus in Los Alamos. The talk is
co-sponsored by UNM-LA, and a link to the map of the campus and the
detailed talk announcement can be found by clicking on 'Events' at the
LAWIS home page <a href="http://nmnwse.org/lawis/">http://nmnwse.org/lawis/</a>.

<P>
The talk is free and open to the general public. Prof. Susan Bilek
recently gave a version of this talk at the Museum of Natural History in
New York, where it was well received. Susan and LAWIS especially
encourage students with an interest in earthquake science to attend.

<P>
Prof. Susan Bilek is a geophysicist in the Earth and Environmental
Science Department of New Mexico Tech with an interest in earthquake
processes, focusing on determining the important factors which influence
the nature of the seismicity. Please contact Susan's LANL host and
collaborator Dr. Charlotte Rowe, <a href="mailto:char@lanl.gov">char@lanl.gov</a>, if you would like to
discuss research with Susan during her visit. Please contact Dr. J.
Tinka Gammel, <a href="mailto:jtg@lanl.gov">jtg@lanl.gov</a>, 667-9149 if you have questions about this
talk or would like to be emailed when future talks are scheduled - the
LAWIS home page also has intructions for subscribing to the LAWIS
listserver.

<P>
LAWIS is the northern chapter of the <a href="http://nmnwse.org">New Mexico Network for Women in
Science and Engineering (NMNWSE)</a>. LAWIS hosts this seminar series as
part of the NMNWSE mission to encourage the entry into and career
development of women in science and engineering. NMNWSE hosts yearly
career Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) conferences targeting middle and
high school girls. This year's LAWIS EYH conference will be at UNM-LA on
March 14. Information about all NMNWSE EYH conferences can be found at
<a href="http://nmnwse.org/lawis/eyh">http://nmnwse.org/eyh/</a>.
