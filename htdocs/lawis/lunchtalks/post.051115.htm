For the past 35 years we have known that the Sun is vibrating like a
giant bell, and its acoustic modes have been used to infer its
interior structure to very high precision.  Our computer models of
the evolution of the Sun over the 4.54 billion years since its
formation could predict these acoustic frequencies to within a few
tenths of a percent.  However, in 2004 the Sun's spectrum was
reanalyzed using improved atmosphere models and atomic physics.  We
found surprisingly that the oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen abundances
in the Sun are 30 to 40% lower than we had previously thought, and
the abundances of other elements are lower by 10-15%.  The percentage
of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in the Sun is now only
1.3% instead of the 2% previously believed.  Now our computer models
do not agree with the helioseismic data!
 

<P>
In this talk, I will give you a tour of the inside of the Sun (and
explain how we know), and discuss the possibilities being considered
to bring the models into agreement again with the acoustic mode data.


<P> <I>Biography</I> - Joyce Guzik has been a member of the Thermonuclear Applications
(Secondary Design) group X-2 since 1988.  She received a Ph.D. in
astrophysics from Iowa State University, and a B.A. in Physics, Math,
and Russian Studies from Cornell College in 1982.  She participated
in the predictions for several underground tests before testing ended
in 1992.  She is currently a team leader and secondary physics
point-of-contact for the W76 Life Extension Program.  Since graduate
school she has continued her astrophysics research, modeling the
interiors and pulsation of the Sun and other variable stars, working
with many collaborators and students.  This summer she presented her
work on the impact of the revised solar abundances at an
international stellar evolution and pulsation conference in Rome,
Italy, and published this work in the Astrophysical Journal.
