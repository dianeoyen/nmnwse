Understanding the quantity and shallow-subsurface expression of individual
earthquakes in regions of blind thrust faults (where the earthquake-generating
fault is deep and does not rupture the Earth's surface) is critical for evaluating
a region's seismic hazard. On a blind thrust fault near San Juan, Argentina, a
magnitude 7.0 earthquake occurred in January 1944.  The La Laja fault, a small
displacement fault associated with the blind thrust and located 25 km northeast
of the provincial capital, recorded minor surface deformation during the 1944
event.  This earthquake was devastating, in that it destroyed 90% of the
infrastructure of San Juan and claimed the lives of as many as 10,000
Argentineans.  The 1944 San Juan seismic event had important cultural
significance, as the post-earthquake recovery efforts brought Juan Peron
and his legendary wife Evita together and also catalyzed Juan Peron's rise to
political power in Argentina.

Two studies along the La Laja Fault System near San Juan provide an intriguing
look at past earthquake records in the area.  Seventeen trenches were excavated
in the La Laja Fault System during a field campaign in 2005, and show that
separate portions of the fault system record differing numbers of paleoearthquakes.
Also, the geometry of geologic units in the trenches unveils information about
activity on the blind thrust fault, which is located more than 10 km below the
Earth's surface.  Through this study, obtaining the quantity of paleoearthquakes
and the mechanism by which the fault deforms allows a clarified understanding of
seismic hazard to regions of blind thrust faulting. (<I>LA-UR-06-8120</I>)

<P><I>Biography</I> - A proud, born-and-raised cheesehead, Emily Schultz received her
undergraduate degree in geology from Lawrence University in Appleton,
Wisconsin in 2002.  After her undergraduate work, she spent nearly
two years as a post-baccalaureate fellow on the Seismic Hazards
Geology Team in EES Division at LANL.  Emily left LANL and New Mexico
in 2004 to pursue a master's degree from Oregon State
University.  She returned to LANL's EES Division in April 2006 to
assist the Seismic Hazards Geology Team with a large-scale field
project.  Emily continued to work on her thesis, successfully
defending it in October 2006.  This talk is a portion of her master's
thesis research.

<!--
<P> <hr width="30%">
The room is reserved from 11:30 to 1:00 so people to can get together and network before and/or after the talk.
Bring your lunch or pick up 
something at Hot Rocks Java Cafe on the 2nd floor.
You are welcome to come early, late, or for just the talk at noon,
 and questions are encouraged!<br>
