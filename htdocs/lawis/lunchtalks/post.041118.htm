<P>
Software complexity grows constantly; with it grow both importance
and difficulty of software testing.  Traditionally, a White Box (open code)
test relies mainly on the expertise of an individual tester, rather than on
any formalized method. In particular the testers rarely use formal methods
to ensure test completeness, majority of tests are superfluous and very
time consuming.

<P>
Systematic method for White Box testing of sequential programs is
proposed. The method is independent of programming language. It finds a
minimal set of paths, which cover the whole code. It ensures that each part
of the code is executed at least once during the test.  Additionally, in
case that tests of one of the paths fails, the problem area is well
localized inside the program code.

<P>
The analysis within the method begins with the program flowchart
represented as an Activity diagram (UML).  Each part of the code is
assigned to an appropriate decision or action point. The Activity diagram
is then translated to a directed graph: points become nodes, arrows become
directed edges.  This translation allows for calculation of the number of
independent paths. The vector space of paths is defined. Independence of
the paths is equivalent to linear independence of the vectors assigned to
individual paths.  It is sufficient to test any base of the paths space to
complete the test.  A method for effective choice of simple base of paths
is presented.

<I>Biography:</I> Hanna Makaruk started to work at LANL in '96 as a Director Funded
Postdoctoral Fellow, and is now a TSM. She is a physicist with interest
in computer science. Currently she is working in P-22.
