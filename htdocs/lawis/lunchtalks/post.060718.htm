<P>
Los Alamos Women in Science (http://nmnwse.org/lawis) and 
the LANL Science and Technology Base Education Programs Office (STBPO) have
scheduled this panel discussion as a mentoring opportunity for students. Panelists
will give a brief introduction of what they do and the path that led them to their
present job and interests, and then the floor will be opened to questions from the
students. Feel free to bring your lunch and enjoy it along with the discussions.

<P>
Questions that have come up in the past have touched on a wide variety of issues,
including the two career problem, balancing work and children, working in a
predominantly male environment, handling unwanted advances, and 'how do I get into
that field?'.

<P>
More information will also be found in the article in 'Student News and
Student Views', due out around June 29, which should be available online
shortly off the LANL Student Association webpage, http://sa.lanl.gov, under
documents.

<P>
<B>If you would be interested in attending the panel, please contact Kristin
Patterson, kpatterson@lanl.gov, 5-6346, to check space availability. Attendance is
limited to 30, and students receive first priority. </b>

<P>
If you have questions or would like to volunteer to be on the panel, please
contact Kristin or Tinka Gammel, jtg@lanl.gov, 7-9149. We can use people who have had a
fairly straightforward path to science as well as people who careers have taken
more complex paths, and people at any stage of their career.

<P>
If you have a student job opening or other announcements or materials you'd like
us to distribute to the students attending the panel, please let Kristin or Tinka know.
