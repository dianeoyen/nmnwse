<b>Introduction<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Los Alamos Women in Science is an organization dedicated to
serving its members through networking and outreach programs.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This booklet is designed to be a resource
for men and women who are contemplating having or adopting children.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The decision to start a family is not one
that should be taken lightly, and we hope that this booklet will provide some
information and reassurance for couples who have decided to join the club of
parents around the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are
many resources available about pregnancy in books, on the internet, and from
friends and family, but we thought that the personal experiences of parents at
Los Alamos would be valuable because they show how new parents are coping with
the many difficulties associated with working at Los Alamos (or anywhere, for
that matter) and raising children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This booklet is divided into several sections, focusing on
issues that are recurring topics of discussion among LAWIS members.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is in no way intended to be a
comprehensive guide to pregnancy, and it mostly covers routine deliveries of
healthy babies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The focus is not on the
medical side of the process or on health insurance issues.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first topic is pregnancy at work:
declaring your pregnancy, dealing with coworkers, fatigue, stress, maternity
clothes, and delivery experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
second topic is maternity leave: how much time to take off, using leave without
pay, disability, sick leave, and vacation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The third topic is returning to work: full time vs. part time work,
breastfeeding and working, good breast pumps to use, and difficulties breastfeeding.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fourth topic is about day care:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>pros and cons, how to find day care, and
using the Dependent Care program at the Lab.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The fifth topic is finding all of the equipment, necessary and optional,
for keeping baby happy, healthy, and safe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The last topic is a catch all for everything we left out in the previous
five areas, including: coping with fatigue and stress, the changing
relationship with your partner, and messy houses.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy and Work</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are thinking of becoming pregnant, or you are
pregnant, there are some work-related issues that you might want to
consider.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First of all, you want to do
everything you can to ensure a safe pregnancy and healthy baby.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first 12 weeks of your pregnancy are critical,
because all the organs and systems of your babys body are developing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is when your baby is most vulnerable to
chemicals, drugs, ionizing radiation, and household chemicals.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can have your workplace checked out
before you start trying to get pregnant (men and women), or even after you have
the baby if you are nursing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You will
want to contact the Reproductive Health Hazard Program (RHHP) team, which is
composed of people from ESH-2, 5, and 12.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They will meet with you confidentially to discuss your concerns.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You do not need to declare you pregnancy at
this time, and you can get a workplace evaluation without declaring your
pregnancy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They can discuss with you
the pros and cons of declaring your pregnancy, which is a process in which your
line management is notified that you are pregnant.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Here are some perspectives on letting people know youre
pregnant:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#3366FF'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>I had a complication in my pregnancy that landed me in
the ER and therefore caused me to cancel a trip to a conference, and so I had
it known at work that I was pregnant long before I would have chosen to
tell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I'd put it off in general just
because of the risk of miscarriage; I wouldn't want to have to un-tell
people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But as it worked out, I work
with a very great group of men. Most are fathers and so via either their wives
or daughters they had a great deal of empathy for my fatigue, sickness,
difficulty concentrating, and frequent sick-absences.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>I couldn't have asked for more support.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:#3366FF'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:#3366FF'>Since I
routinely work with gram quantities of plutonium, I tend to err on the side of
caution and declare to ESH-2 and my bosses as soon as the pregnancy is
confirmed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, the two times I
became pregnant, the CMR building was shutdown to programmatic work for 4+
months, so I didn't have to really worry about the most formative weeks
anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Had I been trying to get pregnant
(while doing programmatic work) I probably would have donned a lead apron as a
just in case precaution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(Most likely
over kill since I haven't gotten over 400 mrem in a year, which is below the
DOE limit of 500 for pregnant woman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But it would have put my mind at ease).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I didn't really declare to my coworkers until I had to explain why I
couldn't go into the gloveboxes and do work once the CMR restarted programmatic
work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Advice to others would be to
declare early if you work has the potential to affect the developing fetus
(teratogenic chemicals or radioactive work) as the management is required to
place you into a position that will not harm the fetus.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>[This is true if you request a different
position, and if your workplace conditions cannot be made safe.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Management cannot require you to take a
position that will not harm the fetus if you do not want to take such a
position.]</span><span style='color:red'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span></span><span style='color:#3366FF'>Otherwise, declare when you are
comfortable with it, but realize that by 6 months or so, it becomes obvious to
everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:#3366FF'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-right:.5in'>I didn't really have a
plan for this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I ended up telling some
coworkers of relatively comparable age early on because of a planned social
gathering, and a female coworker because I was asking her advice about something.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I also went through the official declaration
process with the lab, even though I'm an office worker and most of the hazard
stuff didn't really apply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You get an
ergonomic analysis of your office, which could be useful, though.</p>

margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:#3366FF'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>I didnt declare at first, because
I thought it wasnt anyones business, but when I needed to work in an area
with potential radiation exposure, I declared to ESH-12, and they did a
complete workplace evaluation of all of the labs and offices I work in and they
issued me a monthly dosimeter (instead of quarterly). My supervisor already
knew I was pregnant, since Id told him already, so it wasnt a big deal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:#3366FF'>I think
the lab has a lot of good resources for expectant parents and for parents
planning to be expectant parents one day soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I took advantage of all of those resources and it helped a lot when it
came time to declare, schedule time off through my group, apply for
disability, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Take advantage of all
the resources available!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These quotations have touched upon the topic of
coworkers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Overall, most people
responding had positive experiences with their coworkers and supervisors.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>Coworkers didn't seem that bad.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Of course you have the occasional person who thinks too highly of
their wittiness and can get aggravating after a while, but I didn't get a whole
bunch of unwanted advice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After having
a horrid one-day vomit bout in my second trimester, another woman who had heard
me throwing up in the bathroom offered me a ride if I ever needed it to
wherever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:#3366FF'>I never
really had a problem with this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Coworkers
seemed to accept it and not dwell on it till those last few weeks when you will
get the never ending you're still here? or you look like you'll pop any
minute now comments. (Course I was 2 weeks overdue and huge as house....)</span></p>

epidurals, while others never use any drugs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The most important lesson is that you will not be able to control the

of the class, they usually give you a tour of the labor and delivery

to ask for a tour of the floor before the big day, that way youll be familiar
with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And, definitely make sure you
know how to get there and where to park, in case the labor happens faster than
you thought! <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Make sure you call the

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have problems with delivery that result in
complications for you or the baby, be sure to ask your doctor about support

many possible scenarios, such as premature delivery, or having a baby born with
some other medical problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Remember,

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>Check your extended family's medical history. Conditions
that run in your family (diabetes, blood pressure, thyroid) may come out of
hiding during a pregnancy even if you do not normally show any symptoms, and
you and your doctor want to know ahead of time if twins run in your partner's
family. No matter how you have prepared your supervisor and co-workers, these
little surprises can completely revise your plans and schedules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We certainly hope nothing does go wrong, but remember that
pregnancy and childbirth are not 100% risk-free. If you or your child has a
serious complication, be sure to ask about available help. Whatever your
situation, other people have been through something like it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Read, read, learn, learn, follow-up! Your doctors can
generally provide initial pointers to relevant resources, from medical services
and physical therapy, to support groups and even schools. We utilized the
Visiting Nurse service, and in-home visits by physical and speech therapists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Be prepared for your insurance carrier to second-guess some
of the decisions made by you or your medical providers, and to nit-pick whether
everything is really the usual, reasonable, and customary fee. If you need
supplemental medical services, try to comparison shop. Partly this is a
reaction to insurance second-guessing, but it's also practical. Make sure you
know exactly what is wanted from the service, so that you can ask all the right
questions of the available suppliers.</p>

child was born at 28 weeks, with medical bills that caused me to notice the
lifetime maximum clause in the insurance. Some of the second-guessing was
borderline harassment, such as reimbursing 5 identical $75 bills at slightly
different amounts. One $3000 item was only reimbursed after senior LANL
management intervened on our behalf, over a year later. My second child was a
bed-rest baby, and the insurance company at the time refused to pay for a
contraction monitor because it didn't prevent premature labor (well, at least
they did cover the meds).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Public schools are under Federal mandate to provide support
services for children with special needs. In Los Alamos, there is even an
early intervention pre-school that will evaluate your child and tailor a
program to your child's needs. Examples include physical therapy, speech
therapy, classroom and curriculum modifications, and classroom assistants. One
of the most important items the Los Alamos school system provided has been a
heavy dose of awareness to the other students that everyone should be treated
with respect. These programs only work with your input, however. Don't be
afraid to ask for something they didn't think of, or turn down something they
recommend. You know your child better than the diagnostician who sees your
child for a short time in a structured setting.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:

this experience knowing that if we would have adopted a newly born infant from
in-country, I would not have been able to take maternity leave in the form of
sick leave. It truly is not the experience of adopting and raising a baby that
makes new adoptive parents feel less of parents, because of course they are
just as much of a parent and family as natural parents and normal family
situations, it is things such as this type of loop-hole in maternity leave that

<p class=MsoNormal>Disability is topic about which we received many
comments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is very confusing to
figure out how it works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Short-term
disability (formerly called University Paid Disability) will provide short-term
benefits if you are unable to work due to pregnancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>This plan pays 55% of your salary, but only up to $800 per month,
for up to six months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you are only
covered by this plan, and not Employee-Paid Disability, you have a minimum
7-day waiting period, and you must use up to 22 working days of sick leave, or
whatever you have.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you have also
enrolled in the Supplemental Disability Plan (formerly called Employee Paid
Disability) your waiting period is the same for both plans, whatever you
selected when you enrolled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
combination of Short-term and Supplemental Disability will pay 70% of your
salary, with a cap of $10,000 per month, for up to 12 months of disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have a longer waiting period and you want to shorten
the waiting period, or if you dont have employee-paid disability at all, and
you want to sign up for it, the only way you can do this (after your period of
initial eligibility) is by applying to the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>They will do an investigation, where they can ask for any or all
of your medical records.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Based on the
anecdotal experience of women at Los Alamos, it can be difficult to get
approved for disability or to shorten your waiting period to 30 days.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although it is presented as an option, it is
not something that you should plan on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>So, as fair warning, if you have 7 or 30-day disability, and you plan on
having children, it may be worth paying the higher premiums until youre done
having children, or until youve built up 90 or 180 days of sick leave.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It probably goes without saying that, as a
new parent, youll probably be using up most of the sick leave you had saved up
on the inevitable ear infections, fevers, etc., when you have to stay at home
with your child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are lucky enough to have employee-paid disability
with a (7- or) 30-day waiting period, and your pregnancy is normal and you work
right up until your babys birth, you will be able to use this during the first
6 to 8 weeks after the birth of your baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Your waiting period can start anywhere from up to 2 weeks before your
due date, if it is medically necessary, as determined by your doctor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can receive more disability payments if
you have to leave work well before your due date due to medical
complications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You stop working at some
time, and your waiting period clock starts ticking.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>You must take sick (or vacation when you run out of sick) during
the waiting period, which is in calendar days, not working days, so 30 days of
waiting is 22 days of sick or vacation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Then, you start taking leave without pay (LWOP).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you dont have disability, you can just
continue to use your sick and vacation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>With disability, you take leave without pay until it is 6 weeks <i>after
the babys birthday</i> (8 weeks for a c-section).<span style="mso-spacerun:

date, then you delivered (vaginally) on your due date, you have about 2 weeks
of waiting left, and then you get 4 weeks of disability pay.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Disability pays about 70% of your salary,
and only the short-term portion of your payments are taxable, so youre often
bringing home more money than while youre working.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>After the disability period is up, you must decide whether
to continue on LWOP, which you are allowed to do under the FMLA, or if you will
start using vacation, sick, work part time, or go back to work full time.<span

you have been on disability, you must return to work through ESH-2 to return to

<h2>Returning to Work</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This brings us to returning to work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is a very personal decision, and you
probably wont figure out what you want to do until the actual time comes to
decide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do you want to stop working
altogether?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Can you afford to do it?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Can you work part time?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Are you tired of being at home and cant
wait to get back to work full time?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All
of these questions have been answered in both the affirmative and negative by
new parents at Los Alamos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are also questions about how to return to work and
continue to breastfeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For exempt
employees, you are only allowed to take vacation in 4-hour increments.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you want to stop off at daycare and
breastfeed, this can be difficult. There are many different work options that
your supervisor may agree to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You may
find it difficult to return to full time when you want to.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you decide to switch to part-time work,
you may want to get it in writing that you can return to full-time when you
decide you are ready.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='tab-stops:5.5in'>After the baby arrives, life
is harder. I was lucky to be able to convince one of my aunts to live with me
for 5 years. I am not sure she ever understood how much she helped me. I would
get home at lunchtime for breastfeeding. To do this, I arranged my schedule
allowing for some large intervals between morning and afternoon classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you can see, the decision of how to return to work is a
personal one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The decision to return to
work can be tough on a new mom, especially if she is breastfeeding.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The universally recommended breast pump for
a working mom is the Medela Pump-In-Style, a medical-grade electric pump.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can pump both breasts at the same time,
meaning that the session will only take 15 minutes (or less if youre
faster).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With a cigarette-lighter
adapter, you can even pump in the car, although this is not recommended if you
are the one driving!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can purchase
the Medela pump from the LAMC medical supply shop, and also at Growing Life in
Albuquerque (theyll ship it for free) or online.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is about $250, which is quite expensive, however, you can also
rent the pump from the LAMC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you are
going to breastfeed for more that 6 months, or if you are planning on having
more children, purchasing the pump is most cost-effective, especially when you
look at the money you will save not buying formula!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>If you buy a used pump, please purchase a replacement kit for all
of the external pump parts to avoid cross-contamination.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These are available wherever the pumps are
sold for a nominal price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can
continue to pump during the day and nurse at home in the mornings and evenings
for as long as you and your baby want.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>So, returning to work doesnt mean that you have to stop nursing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>Most books you read about motherhood assume one of two
scenarios: either you're breastfeeding and pumping at work to keep your supply
up and provide food for your baby while you're away from her/him, or you bottle
feed formula. There's another possibility-- you've had horrible problems
breastfeeding but still want to give your baby breast milk, so you pump breast
milk and then bottle-feed it to her/him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Trust me, if you meet such a woman, she doesn't want to hear that if
you just tried a little harder or kept with it longer, you could breastfeed
just fine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Inverted nipples and other
breast/mouth problems dont necessarily work themselves out quickly or
easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was wearing shells for 1.5
months before my baby was born, and had made some good progress.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But the three days of no bra wearing (and
thus no shell-wearing) in the hospital when she was born were enough to
obliterate the progress I had made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She
was a relatively small baby as well, so between her small mouth and my non-nipples,
it was basically impossible for her to get a good latch.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So I started pumping.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That process was much more certain and
reliable, and I ended up continuing to do it.</p>

<h2>Daycare</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Returning to work brings up the inevitable issue of who will
take care of your baby during the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>First and foremost, as soon as you get pregnant, start looking into
daycare.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is not much of an
exaggeration to say that you should be on the waiting list before youre even
pregnant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#3366FF'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>I knew what the daycare situation was in town, so I
started looking early (like before I was 2 months along).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I signed up incredibly early (in July for a
June slot), and still didn't know definitively until after she was born that I
had a slot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We heard about other
possibilities in between signing up and knowing, but I just kept faith that we
would get the slot, because it was the most convenient one for us. [My daycare
is] dependable, reliable, and consistent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The people are friendly, and as my daughter grows older, I think she'll
have a lot of fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#3366FF'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>Day care in this town is deplorable -- not that it is
bad, just that it is lacking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Start
looking early -- a year in advance, start educating yourself about options and
making appointments to see places and get on waiting lists. Home-care providers
won't know that far in advance whether they'll have openings, but it's good to
get some referrals that far in advance so you can get acquainted with them
before having to choose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:#3366FF'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>If your situation results in long-term effects on your
child, this may further complicate your daycare options. Never mind infant care
(we hired individual care in our own home, and paid for CPR training), finding
a pre-school or after-school program that can work with you may be difficult. I
don't believe our needs were excessive - no mobility issues such as a wheelchair,
for instance - mostly it was a case of awareness and flexibility. However, one
center in town acted as though his disabilities were our fault, and refused to
even consider any accommodations. Fortunately, two other centers in town were
more than willing to work with him, through the pre-school and elementary
school years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>State-licensed, infant-care providers can be very hard to
come by in Los Alamos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are a few
centers uptown and in White Rock, but you may need to be on their waiting lists
about a year in advance of when you expect to enroll your child.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even then, there is no guarantee, and most
of them require at least 35 hours per week of enrollment.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It helps to be on multiple lists at the
large facilities and also to explore home-based providers through referrals you
get from friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The supply and demand
of daycare is variable, and you should research the current situation if you
are going to need daycare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is currently a proposal by LANL to open a daycare
facility, and you should contact Human Resources for an update on the
proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are no sick-baby
daycare facilities, and you or your partner will have to keep the baby at home
if he/she has a fever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you do have
difficulty finding a daycare provider, please let someone know, either in
LAWIS, WDWG, or in the Human Resources Division.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>If no one knows about problems finding childcare, they will
assume that there are no problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>HR
is working on a database of providers that people will be able to search.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Check their web pages for more information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you do use daycare, LANL has a program called DepCare,
which you can use to get up to $5000 per year of your childcare expenses tax
free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You enroll in the program as soon
as your child is starting daycare, and a fixed amount is deducted from your
paycheck before taxes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This goes into
your personal DepCare fund.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then, you
pay daycare fees out of your pocket, get a receipt from your provider, and
after the care has been provided, you submit your receipts to the U.C., who will
reimburse you out of your DepCare fund.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Right now, the maximum annual amount is $5000, and most peoples daycare
expenses will be greater than that, annually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, if you are in the 20% tax bracket, it saves you $1000 in taxes
annually, so it is well worth the hassle of submitting receipts.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are information booklets about this
benefit on the U.C. benefits web page <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/bencom/">http://www.ucop.edu/bencom/</a>.</p>

<h2>Baby Equipment</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the more fun aspects of having a baby is finding cute

margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:#3366FF'>I think Target
is a good place to buy diapers, since they're often on sale and you can save
something like 30% off the price up here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I don't use formula, but I imagine they have that, too, and since I hear
it's pricey, it's worth the drive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
got most of our basic stuff (infant carrier/car seat/stroller combo,
bassinette) at either Target or Toys-R-Us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But the selection is small here in Northern NM, so we also buy online a

<p class=MsoBlockText>My husband was in heaven when he realized that baby stuff
involves checking it for structural integrity -- crib, stroller, etc -- they
all had to pass his Tests. He insisted our first car seat have the 5-point
restraint, but he admits now that strapping our son into that
jet-fighter-harness is a pain, and the new seat we have has the 3-point
restraint.</p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>Especially if you end up having a small infant, I think
it's better to start with a seat designed especially for their size.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And before they get old enough to sit up and
that sort of thing, having the seat be the kind that's a carrier as well is
really useful for carrying them around and putting them in carts and such.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think that with our daughter, we should be
able to make it to her first birthday without having to switch to another
rear-facing seat, which gives us more choices in toddler seats.</p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>For where we live and how much we thought we would be
strolling, we decided not to get a monster-size stroller and/or travel
system. Instead, we just got a simple lightweight umbrella stroller.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It's easy to transport, and I don't recall a
time we would have used the other kind of stroller before she got big enough to
use the umbrella stroller.</p>

<p class=MsoToc1>As you can tell, there are lots of shopping options.<span

reasonable prices, and there are actually many online baby stores if you dont
have the time or energy to drive to Santa Fe or Albuquerque (RightStart.com,
OneStepAhead.com, etc.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Remember to
keep your baby in a rear-facing car seat until they are 20 pounds and 1 year

<p class=MsoToc1>We asked people to also comment on other issues related to
having a new baby, such as lack of sleep, their relationship with their
partner, and living with a messy house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:#3366FF'>Each night
we put the baby down by about 7:30, pick up his toys and little gym, light some
candles (the mess is less obvious in the dark) and we have a couple hours to
spend together in a nice space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Usually
we're just tired and curl up on the sofa, but it's important to have that time
to just talk, without keeping one eye and ear on a 6 month old dictator. And
some things are just going to slip a bit at the beginning.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Dusty bookshelves are a small price to pay
to spend an extra 5 minutes hearing your child laugh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>Try to sleep as much as you can.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Easily said, not as easily done. (I know
from experience).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Luckily, I have a
baby who began sleeping regularly at night from early on.</p>

the hard way ... let the baby fuss without picking it up in the middle of the
night. Our kids did not sleep through the night until they were over a year old
because my husband would pick them up with every little fuss (I slept right
through). I have been told that if the baby is in a different room than your
own then they will wake you when they really need to be fed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

seriously, the marriage does need to be nurtured and the only way to do that is
to regularly take time by yourselves...this started my husband and me dating.
We have a standing lunch date every Thursday. Our other saving grace was to
send the kids to their grandparents every summer for a spell. We started doing
this when our youngest was about 4 years old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

don't get much [sleep] in the first few weeks, but you usually start to get

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pregnancy, maternity leave, and parenting are often
difficult when one or both of the parents are working.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are resources available for working
parents at LANL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you are pregnant,
or even just thinking about it, you can get workplace evaluations to protect
yourself and your child through the Reproductive Health Hazard Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thanks to the Internet, there are many more shopping options
for Northern New Mexicans, and Target and Sams Club provide a good supply of
staples such as diapers and wipes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
biggest question for working parents is how much time they should take off.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This will depend on many factors:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>health of mom and baby, amount of vacation
and sick leave, disability, how much LWOP you can afford to take, and when
daycare will be available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In Los
Alamos, daycare is a very sensitive topic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In general, people have good experiences with their providers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The difficulties usually lie in finding a
provider with an open slot when you need it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>LANL may be opening a daycare facility, and HR is creating a searchable
online database of local providers.</p>
