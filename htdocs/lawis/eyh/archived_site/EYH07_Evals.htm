<P>The LAWIS EYH07 was co-sponsored by Los Alamos National Lab and UNM-LA, and licensed by NMNWSE from the national EYH network. See <a href="http://nmnwse.org/eyh">http://nmnwse.org/eyh</a> for more information on this program.


<P> This page is for EYH07 planning committee members, presenters, and volunteers. While this page is visible to all, to protect privacy the links to the detailed info will only work for people accessing from LANL computers. If you have a legitimate interest and are not on a LANL computer, please contact the EYH07 Evaluation person, Tinka Gammel, <a href="mailto:jtg@lanl.gov">jtg@lanl.gov</a>, 505-667-9149. For the Teacher Evaluation summary, contact the Teacher Conference co-Chairs (see <a href="../contact">contacts page</a>).

<P><B>Overall summary</B>

<P>
The ethnicity of the student attendees was on average about 2/3 Hispanic, 1/3 White (non-Hispanic), 5% Native American, and 1% Asian. 1% chose not to identify their ethnicity. We did not have any students who identified themselves as African Americans.

<P>About 2/3 of the students were in 8th grade, with the rest fairly evenly split between 9th (15%) and 10th (18%) grade, plus a few in 7th (2%) and 11th (1%) grade. Only 8% had previously attended one or more EYH conferences. The most common way cited as to how they found out about EYH was through their teacher, followed by personal contact. Only 20% indicated they were aware they could register online, and it appears from the comments this was often done by the teacher, although since the question was not specifically asked a firm conclusion cannot be made. There were also problems initially getting the paper and online registration databases to communicate. It remains to be discussed by the planning committee as to whether the online registration was enough of a success to be repeated next year.

<P>60% of the students indicated they had taken algebra I, 25% had taken geometry, 14% had taken algebra II, and 5% had taken trig. However, these statistics have to be corrected for the fact that some students interpreted the question as 'list all', whereas other appeared to interpret as 'list highest', so for example, the percent of students who had taken algebra I is probably slightly higher (detailed analysis not done).


<P>On average, students identified the content as "Mostly Good" shading slightly toward "Fantastic". 
The average difficulty rating was "Just Right" shading slightly toward "Too Easy". This applies to the Workshops (lumped together), Keynote Speaker, and Team Activity.  The Career Panel and Stations were also rated on the easy side of just right, but the content was not rated as high (slightly positive from neutral). However, this may be in part due to the low number of evaluations turned in for this part of the day giving poor statistics, as well as apparent confusion about what the form was asking (as some students rated the content poorly, but had comments that indicated they had a good time).
On average, the students were about evenly split between the conference not changing and the conference improving their attitude about and the likelihood they would take math or science classes or go into a STEM field. The question as asked did not elucidate whether those who were unchanged were already likely to go into these fields or not, which should be added to next year's evaluation forms. A few indicated that the conference decreased the likelihood, but it was not clear from the evaluations as to why - again, the evaluation form needs modification to ask why.  

<P>The comments were generally positive to very positive, but a few students did not have a good time.
As in past years, the form with the spatial bubbles asking  to complete the sentences "I came expecting...", "I got...", "A thing of value I learned is...", "I wish I learned more about...", and "Now I need..." elicited the most useful comments to give insight as to what their experience was. Unfortunately, it was turned in separately from the other evaluations and so one cannot correlate the comments with the data gathered on the other forms, and it also had a low return rate. A suggestion for the committee to consider is to evaluate the entire conference at the end (instead of having partial evaluations at the end of the workshops) so that the responses could be correlated, as long as a way could be found to insure good response rates.  One of the best quotes as to a thing of value learned was "that not only men can be successful in life and women can succeed! (Go Girls)". Clearly we did reach this student, and the many others who had comments like "Awesome!" and "Cool!".

<P>
A spreadsheet of all evaluations is linked below, with notes indicating where the responses may have different interpretations because they were difficult to read or had other ambiguities, and notes from the Evaluation person (Tinka Gammel) on potential lessons learned (to be vetted by full committee).

<P><B>Individual responses</B>

<P>Because of the difficulty of reading some responses, and the possibly confusion as to interpretation of the ratings, scanned copies of the original responses are linked below, so you can form your own opinion on the ones that are not clear.
The numbers on the individual forms in the upper right is the order they were turned in, and the order in the spreadsheet. The unknown ones are likely from workshops above or below in numerical order, but since a few students turned in the forms individually (rather than the gofer turning in all at once), the workshop the evaluation corresponds to cannot be firmly assigned. Where a student accidentally entered identifying information, that has been blacked out.
