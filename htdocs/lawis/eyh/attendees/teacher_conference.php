As women scientists we are aware of the positive influence teachers have on career choices made by students, especially by encouraging female students to pursue engineering, math, science, and technology careers. We hope all adult sponsors will register for TC06. Note you do not need to have students attending EYH06 to register for TC06 - it is open to any interested parent or educator.
