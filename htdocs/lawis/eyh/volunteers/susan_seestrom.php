LANL and    LAWIS have co&#8208;sponsored 28 of these technical workshops for 8th, 9th, and    10th grade girls from Northern New Mexico. The continued student    participation in this workshop speaks to its value. In addition to&nbsp;hands&#8208;on&nbsp;student    workshops conducted by Laboratory and community women scientists, there will    be a special session for adult sponsors. </p></td>
