ACTING ACTING PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
---------------------------------

Carol LaDelfe is on travel through the end of the month and used her
executive powers to appoint me temporary president.  Please feel free
to contact me if there is anything I can help with this month.  So far,
my only official act has been to agree NOT to schedule our summer picnic
to conflict with the LANL student summer picnic. Which reminds me,
any volunteers to help plan the LAWIS picnic??

LAWIS LUNCHES
-------------

The LAWIS Lunch-Time Talks Series is well on it's way to becoming a
venerable tradition (at least, I hope!).  Since the last newsletter,
Mary Stinecipher Campbell of DX-2 at LANL gave a talk and demonstration
on "Positive Uses of High Explosives".  This was quite informative,
explaining the different between conflagration, deflagration, and
detonation, and the demonstration (also presented to the girls who
participated in her workshop at EYH) was a lot of fun with a bit of a
surprise at the end.  I have a copy of Mary's handout on the story of
dynamite which I can give to interested people, and she was willing to
give a repeat should there be sufficient interest at a later date. The
audience at this talk proved LAWIS is a non-discriminatory organization
(it was approximately 20% male). Unfortunately it was also clear that
LAWIS is not a very radical organization or more of us would have been
there to hone our explosives skills...

The talk by Janie Enter of CST-7 at LANL on her "Checkerboard Career"
was much better attended -- of course, we did offer free pizza
and were handing out appreciation gifts to those who helped with EYH --
and had a very lively discussion following. Janie has had experience
with many different job situations, and is a good resource for those
who might need to talk with someone when their career path deviates
from the straightforward.  Pointers from Janie Enter's talk:

1) Survival Tips:
  - believe in yourself
  - network, network, network
  - don't get sick
  - may be a good idea to hide your best work
  - participate in Laboratory activities
  - be persistent but polite
  - play dumb if you have to ("listen to Janis Joplin" later)
  - support the administrative assistants

2) Useful LANL Organizations
  - EAC
  - SEAC
  - DVO
  - Special Interest Topics
  - DOE Review of Laboratory Programs for Women
  - LAWIS

3) Useful External Organizations
  - League of Women Voters
  - National Association for Women in Education
  - American Association of University Women

4) Don't give up
  - even when the turkeys try to keep you down!

Two books by Sheila Tobias were recommended in the ensuing discussion:
 -- They're Not Dumb, They're Different: Stalking the Second Tier
 -- Rethinking Science As A Career
The publisher is "Research Corporation". Let me (Tinka, 7-9149,
jtg@lanl.gov) know if you would like to see LAWIS get a copy of these
books for our "reference library" (which currently consists of a few
articles and some videos on gender-bias in science and the like --
contact me if you would like to see the "library"), or if you need help
locating a copy for your own perusal.

The next LAWIS Lunch-Time Talk is scheduled for 12:00 noon Tuesday May 20.
Michelle Thomsen of NIS 1 at LANL has agreed to talk on "Space Weather",
which promises to be another very interesting talk. Hope to see you there!

AAUW PAY EQUITY SURVEY
----------------------

Following on the discussion after Janie's talk mentioned
in the previous article, Denise George thought people might
be interested in this:

FAIRNESS IN COMPETITION GAME -- ANSWERS
AAUW survey from approximately 1990

1. In survey after survey, what issue is in the top three for
   working people? [PAY EQUITY]

2) What is the ratio of women's pay to men's pay in the US?  [71%]

3) What is the ratio for hispanic women? [53%]

4) What is it in NM? [67% PER 1990 CENSUS]

5) What AAUW branch was the first to start a pay equity
   project?  [D.C.] When? [1913]

6) What is the significance of April 11? [PAY EQUITY DAY,
   WHEN FEMALE SALARIES CATCH UP TO MALES]

7) Why isn't the Equal Pay Act enough? [IT HAS HELPED,
   BUT 33 YRS LATER THERE IS STILL A SUBSTANTIAL WAGE GAP.
   FEMALE WORK IS UNDERVALUED.]

8) Some conservatives (e.g., Suzanne Fields) say wage
   inequities are largely solved. What statistic do they use
   and what are they distorting? [WOMEN AGES 27-33 WITHOUT
   CHILDREN ARE EQUAL. APPLES AND ORANGES COMPARISON OF WOMEN
   WITHOUT CHILDREN TO MEN WITH/WITHOUT.  ALSO, AS WOMEN MATURE,
   WAGE GAP WIDENS. OVERALL IT's A 71% WAGE GAP.]

9) Please order these groups according to median wages (1=top)
   __ White Men
   __ Hispanic Men
   __ Black Men
   __ White Women
   __ Hispanic Women
   __ Black Women
   [ANS: SAME AS ORDER LISTED]

10) Which ethnic/racial/gender group has the highest labor
    participation rate in NM and the second highest in the U.S.?
    [AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN]

11) What is the wage gap between men and women in these jobs?
    Managers? [32%] Secretaries? [10%] College Professors? [22%]
    Elementary School Teachers? [12%]

12) What happens to wages when men begin to dominate a job?
    [WAGES GO UP] What happens to wages when females begin to
    dominate a job? [WAGES GO DOWN]

13) T/F: The wage gap between men and women can be attributed
    to men having more education, experience, and time on the job.
    [NOT TRUE. THIS IS A MYTH! MANY STUDIES, E.G. NATIONAL ACADEMY
    OF SCIENCE, AMERICAN COMPENSATION ASSOCIATION, HAVE SHOWN THESE
    LEGITIMATE FACTORS ACCOUNT FOR ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THE WAGE GAP.]

Denise also had a very amusing article on why women should pay
lower income taxes (we don't commit as many crimes so we burden
society less). Maybe I'll include it if there is an April 15 Issue 
next year...

STANDARDS FOR THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN NM SCHOOLS
---------------------------------------------------

In light of recent election results and that the NM State Science
Standards and Benchmarks are once again being revised, especially
as concerns the teaching of "a science based theory of human origin",
people might be interested in the following list of important state
science and education/teacher organizations.

I think all of us consider the erosion of academic standards
in the schools is a travesty. It has been proposed that LAWIS
form a working group to inform themselves and recommend
possible action on this important issue. If you would like to
be a part of this working group, please let me (Tinka, 7-9149,
jtg@lanl.gov) know.

1997 EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS
-----------------------------------

We had a very successful Expanding Your Horizons program March 20, 1997.
Nearly 120 8th-10th grade girls and 25 teachers/adults participated from
many schools in Northern New Mexico.  We almost filled the study center to
its 150 person capacity.  John Webster gave us some great pre-conference
publicity with his article and interviews in the March issue of
Reflections.  The program included a team-building activity, in which the
girls used straws and paper to construct an egg-protection device that
allowed their raw egg to be dropped from increasing heights without
breaking; morning and afternoon hands-on scientific workshops; a cookout
lunch at Otowi patio; and guest presentations by Dr. Barbara Stine and Dr.
Diane Albert of Los Alamos.

From my perspective as a co-coordinator, the most important highlight was
the star volunteers.  I don't have space here to acknowledge everyone, but
sponsoring EYH is a big enterprise; as a measure, Deborah Kubicek purchased
over 60 mugs as appreciation gifts for EYH volunteers.  Wendee Brunish and
Karen Schultz-Paige recruited presenters and "gofers" and arranged
logistics for 15 hands-on workshops given in the morning and afternoon.
They added several workshops at the last minute as the registration
steadily grew beyond our expectations.  Diane Albert raised an incredible
amount of funding from lab and outside sponsors (over $7000).  In addition,
when we needed an afternoon guest speaker, Diane came to the rescue and
presented a very interesting talk on her research in high-tech materials.
Judy Kares and Santa Fe AAUW members visited Santa Fe schools and recruited
a sizable percentage of our participants, in addition to helping out on
the day of the conference.

We had excellent reports from the adults on the workshops presented by
Garry Franklin at the Science Museum, and Bill Powell and friends of the
American Vacuum Society on classroom science demonstrations and activities.
Carol LaDelfe, Ann Mauzy did their usual efficient job with registration.
Tinka Gammel, Margo Clark, Denise George, Sandy Fletcher, Pat Berger, and
Trish Wright helped out with numerous behind-the-scenes arrangements.
Deborah Kubicek and Ginger Young orchestrated the popular egg-drop team
activity.  Shirley Herrera acted as co-coordinator, and helped to see that
less slipped through the cracks as well as organizing the great cookout
lunch and reserving facilities.  We also greatly appreciate the help of
PA-4, the conference and visit management group, particularly Patsy
Martinez for running a professional conference.  Also we thank Patty
Mahoney for finishing the ES&H approval for the workshops on short notice.

We are hoping with the experience and financial foundation of this year to
make next year's EYH even more successful.  I know from the evaluations,
letters and calls I've received that you have made a difference in
encouraging young women to consider the option of a career in science.  I
hope you will help us again next year (tentative date Thursday March 12,
1998) with your diverse talents.

LAWIS AT BRING YOUR KIDS TO WORK DAY
------------------------------------

For "Bring Your Kids To Work Day" at LANL, myself (Tinka Gammel),
Denise George, and Nely Padial staffed two LAWIS demonstrations
in the Otowi cafeteria siderooms during the lunch hours.
The first was "Mathematics of Games".  We brought in several games
with topological, combinatoric, and other math themes (e.g., a
Rubrix cube). We let the kids play while trying to point out
the mathematical principles. The second was "Magnets". I brought
my box of magnets and iron filings gleaned from a local arroyo
and tried to demonstrate action at a distance and making invisible
things visible, but mostly leaned all sorts of new games one
can play with big magnets. At any rate the kids had a lot of fun,
hopefully saw not all science is boring, and maybe even
learned a thing or two.

SURVEYING YOUR FUTURE BOOKLET BEING REVISED
-------------------------------------------

The "Surveying Your Future" Booklet aimed at encouraging teenage girls
with an interest in science is being revised. Contact dede Collins,
dede@lanl.gov, 5-2349, if you are able to help or would like
more information.
