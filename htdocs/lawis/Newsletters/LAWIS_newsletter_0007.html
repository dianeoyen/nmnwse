<h2><A name=pres></a>PRESIDENT'S SOUP&Ccedil;ON</h2>
<p>From our fearless leader, Janie Enter:
<br>
<br>
Wow, what a month...that <i>never</i> was.  May is a complete blur to me, and my thanks goes to those 
LAWIS Steering Committee members that jumped in to initiate actions that needed to be done right away.  
For instance, a claim for the LAWIS losses had to be initiated immediately.  Both members of the State 
Board, Ann Mauzy, Angelique Neuman, and Alexine Salazar took initiative and endured the paperwork processing 
to get this claim started.  <font color=green><b>Thank you very much</b></font>.
<br><br>
LAWIS condolences go out to <b>Tinka</b>, who lost her home (and our excellent storage area) in the Cerro Grande 
fire.  She has promised to make her next garage twice the size to store more!  As far as replacing her 
losses, she has said, </p>

<p align=center><font color=blue>"What would be most appreciated would be a few copies of pictures or other small 
memento to help replace my 'lost memories', or begin new ones."</font>
</p>

Additionally, <b>Ternel Martinez</b>, public affairs liaison between LAWIS and LANL, lost his home as well.  
Our sympathies go out to him.  There is, however, some exciting news in his life.  He is in the process of 
adopting a <font color=magenta>girl</font>.  Unfortunately, the process is on hold until he obtains the FEMA housing, which should be 
very soon.  The process will then be restarted, and he will be a proud father in the near future!
<br><br>

Our most excellent LAWIS Lunchtime Talk Coordinator, <b>Huyen Dinh</b>, is in the process of interviewing and may 
be leaving us very soon, perhaps even sooner than anticipated.  With the resignation of Carol Hogsett, who 
was to replace Huyen, a tremendous void exists.  We are currently soliciting nominations and volunteers to 
fill this important position.  Please contact any LAWIS Steering Committee members if you know of someone or 
if you would be willing to take on this vital role in LAWIS.
<br><br>

The American Association for the Advance of Science (AAAS) will be in Los Alamos on or around August 1, 
2000.  Their intention is to solicit participation in <b>AAAS Fellowship Programs</b>.  Currently, they are 
coordinating efforts with Allen Hartford in STB, but I have suggested that they also give a lunchtime talk 
for LAWIS.  Additionally, they are considering talking at the State Convention in Ruidoso in October.   
Details will be forthcoming.  It sounds like exciting stuff for women in science!
<br><br>

The next Steering Committee Meeting will be held on Thursday, July 13, at 7:00 am in Side Room A of Otowi.  
The tentative agenda is listed below:
<br>
<ul>
   <li>Approval of the June, 2000 minutes - Ann
   <li>Treasurer's Report - Susana
   <li>Discussion and Approval of the By-Laws - Mary
   <li>Establishment of Nominating Committee
   <li>Newsletter and Flyer Discussion - Laura
   <li>Miscellaneous Business
</ul>

As always, if you have questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.  
I have already been on a "vacation" and am not planning on going anywhere for quite awhile.

<h2><A name=announce></a>ANNOUNCEMENTS, EVENTS, ETC.</h2>
<p>
<ol>
   <li><b><font color=red>CALL FOR NOMINATIONS.</font></b> Georgia Pedicini passed on the following information about two 
prestigious, career enhancing awards for early career researchers. <br>
<b><i>
Presidential Early Career Award - DPEarly Career Scientist and Engineer Award
</i></b>

The award is given to researchers employed by Academic 
Institutions and funded by a Defense Programs Laboratory. To be eligible for nomination, researchers must 
have been <u>funded for no more than five years</u> and must be working on their <u>first contracts since receiving 
their Ph.D</u>. Nominations are due to DOE by July 21, 2000. <br>
<b><i>
Presidential Early Career Award - Office of ScienceEarly Career Scientists and Engineer Award.
</b></i>
Nominees for this award must be <u>full-time employees of a DOE 
Laboratory</u>, be in their <u>first five years</u> as an independent investigator (beyond postdoc) and have 
<u>obtained peer reviewed DOE/Office of Science funding</u>. Nominations are due to DOE by July 12, 2000. 

If you areinterested in submitting a nomination for either of these prestigious awards, STB asks that you 
contact their office (665-6110) to coordinate a unified Laboratory response. You'll notice that the award 
criteria are different, and the deadlines are fairly close (and also different for the two awards).


   <li><b>PAST EVENTS.</b>  Unfortunately, I do not have a report on Alyssa Olson's talk, but I'll try to 
get a report for the next issue.  However, Lisa Gutierrez, the director of the Laboratory's Diversity 
Office, gave a lively discussion on <font color=green><b>"TEAMING FOR SUCCESS: The Power of Diversity,"</b></font color> on June 28th.  
Despite rudimentary tools (no screen for the overhead projector) and an untimely power outage, Lisa managed 
to cover a variety of important topics: Laboratory support for diversity initiatives, the importance of 
diversity issues to recruiting and retaining talent, and her efforts to build resources and streamline the 
mission of her organization.  If you've got Diversity questions/issues, I promise that she'll be a great 
contact for you.  Thanks to Lisa for an informative and very entertaining afternoon, even if part of it was 
in the dark!

   <li><b>COMING UP FAST.</b> Rose Barrientes de Scott, Public Affairs/Legislative Liaison, 
"WASTE ISOLATION PILOT PLANT: Environmentally Safe Nuclear Waste Disposal," July 12, 2000, at the Otowi 
Side Room C.  The slide presentation introduces the group to WIPP.  What, Where and Why is WIPP so important?  It outlines the truck route, the safety involved and truck monitoring.  Question and answer session at the end.
