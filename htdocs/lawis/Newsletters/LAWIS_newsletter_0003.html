<h3><a name=min></a>STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING MINUTES</h3>

<p>The February meeting of the LAWIS Steering Committee took place on February 7th, 2000, in
the back of the Otowi cafeteria.  Attendees included Laura McNamara, Alexine Salazar,
Angelique Neuman, Cathy Cleland, Mary Steincipher Campbell, Susana Delano, Huyen Dinh, Ann
Mauzy, Dana Roberson, and Janie Enter.  Invited, but unable to make it: Margo Clark, Vice
President and President Elect of NMNWSE, Dolores Montano (Co-Chair of EYH), Tinka Gammel
(giving a presentation in Santa Fe), and Carol LaDelfe, current President of the NMNWSE. The
meeting was called to order.  In absence of the secretary, the proposed agenda was
switched.</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>
Treasurer's Report:</b> Susana Delano gave the Treasurer's Report.  She had received the books
from Trish Wright, and noted that they need to be audited soon.  Cathy found the statement
in the bylaws outlining the procedure to follow in auditing the books.  The bylaws state
that two people must audit the books: one member of the Steering Committee, accompanied by
one person who is not a member of the Steering Committee.  Angelique offered to represent
the Steering Committee and also to contact Claudia Lewis, who is the NMNWSE Treasurer, to
fill the position of the nonmember of the Steering Committee.  Angelique will ask her to
fulfill this function at the State Board Meeting on Saturday, February 12, 2000.  The books
will be audited shortly thereafter.  Additionally, reimbursement Cathy Cleland in the amount
of $125 for the gift certificates for the Science Fair winners was motioned, and seconded. 
It passed unanimously.  Susana had already reimbursed her from Susana's personal account. 
The Steering Committee agreed that Susana be reimbursed from the LAWIS funds in the amount
of $125.   A request to furnish a check for a subscription replacing one that was never
received as a prize in last year's EYH, was motioned, seconded, and passed unanimously. 
Finally, Susana will take the action item to find out who has signature authority on the
LAWIS account, and to have it updated so that we can meet our financial obligations and
commitments.  Additionally, there is a strong possibility that Susana will need a substitute
Treasurer during her pending absence, perhaps beginning in late February and extending
through most of March.  It will be important that others will have signature authority in
her absence.</p>
<p>
<b>
Membership Report: </b>Cathy Cleland gave the membership report.  She has received the 
membership list from the NMNWSE State office, along with some membership renewals and new
membership applications.  She has not had a chance to digest the copious information, but
will do so soon.  Also, there was a request that she let the Steering Committee members know
if they had paid their dues.  She will let us know at the next meeting in March.</p>
<p>
<b>
Lunchtime Talks:</b> Huyen Dinh reported that the Lunchtime Talks are coming smoothly.  One of
the Steering Committee members asked if we could change the focus to be one of a technical
nature so that folks would not have to give up their lunchtime for professional growth.  A
note was made that one of the criteria included in DOE's Review of Laboratory Programs for
Women included "Technical Symposium for Women." Janie volunteered to ask Wendee  (National
Chair of DOE's Review of Laboratory Programs for Women) if there was some way that we could
couple both LAWIS and this criteria.  </p>
<p><b>Expanding Your Horizons:</b> Alexine Salazar updated the Steering Committee on the status of
EYH, which took place on the 6th of March.  Information about this year's EYH can be found
on the LAWIS webpage. </p>
<p><b>NMNWSE:</b> Janie presented a brief overview and history of LAWIS and NMNWSE, Who's Who in the
Network, Board Meeting dates, How does LAWIS fit into the bigger picture?, etc.  For more
information, the webpage is: <a href="http://www.NMNWSE.org/">www.NMNWSE.org</a>.</p>
<p><b>Los Alamos Science Fair Report:</b> Cathy Cleland provided the report for the Science Fair.  It
is clear that a good time was had by all.  And, there were some super terrific projects. In
addition to a gift certificate to Otowi Station, winners were awarded a <img src="/home/lawis/Pretty/atom.gif"><font color=red><b>"Trust Me, I'm a
Scientist"</b></font> bumper sticker, a LANL Science Serving Society Poster, and a LAWIS certificate
(printed on some really cool dinosaur paper). Top prizes went to:
<br>
<ul>
<li><font color="#31007B"><b>$25 - Maeve Sterbenz, What's the Best Detergent for Getting Rid of that Stain? </b></font>
<li><font color=navy><b>$15 - Barbara Wendelberger, Plants, Acids, and Bases</b></font>
<li><font color=green><b>$10 - Analisa Sandoval, Why go to Bed?</b></font> 
</ul>
Additional Awards included a $5 Otowi Station Gift Certificate (one each for joint
projects), a "Trust Me, I'm a Scientist" bumper sticker, a 'Science Serving Society Poster,'
and a LAWIS certificate. Winners included:<br>
<ul><font color="#840052">
<li><b>Katherine Durrer and Katherine Rudell, Hampster Dance </b>
<li><b>Krista Edwards and Elise Alde, Presenting MOLD!</b> 
<li><b>Rachel Mercer-Smith, Do Kids Walk Like Clocks Tick?</b>
<li><b>Anna K. Miller, Aquadrag</b>

<li><b>Karen Meyers, The Bread Baker's Dilemma </b>
<li><b>Phoebe Toole, Static Electricity</b>
<li><b>Blanca Olivas, Lost Your Marbles</b>
</font></ul>
</p>
<p><b>Other Science Fair News: </b>Cathy Cleland mentioned that a science teacher had approached her
about giving awards at the 44th Annual Northeastern New Mexico Science and Engineering Fair
held at the New Mexico Highlands University on March 4th, 2000.  LAWIS donated $50 for
awards, along with more of our famous dinosaur award certificates, which 'are a real hit
among the younger generation,' Cathy tells us. Categories included Botany, Environmental
Science, Chemistry, Engienering, Physics, Zoology, Mathematics, Behavioral and Social
Science, Medicine and Health, biochemistry, Computer Science, Microbiology, Earth and Space,
and Team. The donation put us in the "<font color=gray><b>Silver Donor</b></font>" category!</p>
<p><b>By-Laws:</b> Mary Stinecipher-Campbell has researched the available by-laws for LAWIS.  She will
be updating them, soon.  However, the biggest discrepancy was "When should we start our
fiscal year, January 1 or October 1?"  After a bit of discussion, the motion was made to
follow the NMNWSE lead, which follows the October 1 calendar.  It was seconded, and almost
passed unanimously.  With this information, Mary can proceed in her updating.</p>
<p><b>Newsletter:</b> Laura McNamara updated us on the Newsletter.  She would like to have text
submitted to her by the 15th or 20th of the month, for insertion in the next outgoing
newsletter.  The anticipated date of release will be around the first of each month.  She
also asked permission to place on the newsletter a request to let her know that it is being
read.  </p>
<p><b>Secretary's Report: </b>Ann Mauzy was ill and was only able to stay briefly.  We postponed the
approval of January's minutes and other secretarial decisions until next month's meeting.</p>
<p><b>Odds and Ends:</b>
<ul>
   <li>Some interest has been generated as to whether or not LAWIS should affiliate with the
National Council of Women's Organizations.  Action Item:  Steering Committee will visit the
site (listed below) to decide by the next meeting if this is an appropriate action to take
or not. http://www.womensorganizations.org/
   <li>Some interest has been generated because of the large number of requests from elementary
schools to participate in EYH.  Because of the age differential it is extremely difficult to
accommodate younger aged girls.  However, it was suggested that AAUW would be an excellent
alternative with their Careers and Curiosity Workshops.  Also, it was suggested that LAWIS
might do something for "Take Your Daughters to Work Day,' and maybe a "Mall Chemistry"
display at one of the Santa Fe shopping malls to generate interest among younger girls. 
Janie volunteered to follow up on some ideas and suggestions.  She will email something to
the EYH presenters and the LAWIS mailing list to craft something.
  <li>Cathy Cleland was contacted by someone at Highlands University to approach LAWIS about
science fair judges.  She will contact the Newsbulletin and send to the LAWIS mailing list
the contact information.

<h3><a name=pres></a>PRESIDENT'S SOUPÇON: A MESSAGE FROM JANIE ENTER, LAWIS  PRESIDENT 2000</h3>
<p>And, we're off!   March 6, 2000 was EYH.  It has really expanded this year.  As of 2/27/00 we
had 159 girls registered from 22 different schools.  In the end, 168 girls registered from 23 schools! What a great turnout!  The schools range from Pecos to
Questa, including just about everywhere else in between.  Mesa Vista sent girls, too!  
Santa Fe Indian School sent a large group, with many attending from pueblos throughout
the state.  The New Mexico School for the Deaf also sent a group.   Something we have
learned this year is that the demand is increasing, not only in the number of girls
attending, but also in the number of teachers requesting to attend the Teacher Component. 
So, in the planning for next year, this will be a topic we should address.  Also, we
received inquiries from at least six different elementary schools to allow them to
participate in both portions.  Unfortunately, we had to turn their requests down, but we
will keep that in mind for planning for the future.  Alexine Salazar did a fantastic
job in keeping us all in line and marching forward.  Diane Albert surpassed other years
in obtaining at least 18 different workshops.  Patty Mahoney coordinated the rooms and
presenter needs with Diane.  Diane's work in obtaining the special needs from each presenter
has been extremely helpful in making room assignments.  Mabel Grey-Trujillo and Trish Wright
came up with some really cool gifts for the team activities, presenters, and main
speaker. Which, by the way, the team activity sounded really fun, thanks to Lori Risinger's
resourcefulness.  I hope you got to see it!  I couldn't wait.  Tinka continues to be a wonderful
webmistress.  And, Becky Parker has come up with some super things for the teachers to
experience while they are here.  Kudos to everyone.</p>

<p>This is a reminder for the next LAWIS meeting on Thursday, March 9, 2000. It will be held in
Side Room C at Otowi Cafeteria at 7:00 am.  Agenda is below.  Bring coffee and greet the day
with us! </p>

<h3><A name=eyh></a>EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS</h3>
<p>LAWIS members worked hard to get EYH off the ground on the 6th of this month, and deserve
high praise.  A report on this year's EYH events, which included a presentation by Stehane
Howard of the National Science Foundation, will appear in April's Newsletter. And for those
of you who wondered about the EYH Career Booklets' Status, Ann Mauzy took the EYH disks to
Alphagraphics in Santa Fe and got a great price quote for getting the career booklets
printed, just in time for EYH.  Thanks to Ann for all her hard work. </p>

<b>Lunchtime Talk, Tuesday, March 14, 2000 11:30 am - 1:30 pm, Otowi Cafeteria Side Room C:</b>
Claudia J. Lewis, EES-1, LANL "Using Quaternary dating methods, stratigraphy and patterns of
stream incision to constrain models of post-orogenic rock uplift: Preliminary results from
the Ebro basin, Spain. " ABSTRACT:  In the central Ebro basin (Spain) and adjacent Pyrenees,
we are testing models of post-tectonic rock uplift using patterns of stream incision
constrained by Quaternary stratigraphic and dating methods.  Ultimately, this project will
provide a precise Quaternary chronology, a basin-wide correlation of river terraces, and a
model of post-tectonic rock uplift that will prove essential to Quaternary studies on the
Iberian peninsula and elsewhere.  The 20-minute technical talk will be preceded by a
discussion of where I've been and where I'm going.<br>

Irene J. Beyerlein, MST-8: STRUCTURE PROPERTY RELATIONS, will be giving a talk entitled
'Micromechanical Stress Redistribution Models And Their Implications On Statistical Failure
Of Composites.' ABSTRACT: In this talk, I will present results from various shear lag models
for stress redistributions from multiple fiber breaks in large, unidirectional continuous
fiber composites. Agreement is quantified for simple configurations of fiber breaks. The
implications of these stress concentration results on statistical crack formation are
discussed. Closed form expressions for key fiber stress concentrations are applied in
developing probabilistic strength theories. The analytical probability models predictions
are shown to be in good agreement with empirical distributions from representative Monte
Carlo simulations of elastic composite fracture.<br><br>
