<h3><a name=min></a>STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING MINUTES</h3>
<p>
FYI - These minutes are very recent - June 8th - and the Steering Committee hasn't yet 
approved or edited them.
</p>

<p><b>MINUTES:</b><BR>The Steering Committee for Los Alamos Women in Science met Thursday,
June 8, at 7:00 a.m., in Side Room A of the cafeteria. Members present were Cathy Cleland, 
Ann Mauzy, Janie Enter, Mary Campbell, Susana Delano, Angelique Neuman, and Margo Clark. 
Members absent were 
Dolores Monta&#241;o, Laura A. McNamara, Huyen Dinh, and Dana Roberson. 
</p>

<p><b>APPROVAL OF MINUTES:</b><BR>Approval of Minutes: Minutes of meetings from 3/9, 4/13, and 4/27 were approved as 
corrected: on 3/9, change "Susana Delgado" to Susana Delano; on 4/13 clarify "discussion of financial
 records" to show that Janie has the checkbooks and financial records; on 4/27 note that Janie has the EYH video 
tapes in her office. 
</p>


<p><b>EYH:</b><BR>The Northern Chapter EYH report was accepted. Janie will ask Alexine to provide 
a summary. 
</P>

<p><b>TREASURER'S REPORT:</b><BR>According to the latest statements, the savings account has $917.88; 
Account 1 has $2,044.97; Account 5 (EYH) has $1.10; The annual meeting account has $841.64. A 
motion was offered to transfer from Account 1 into the savings account the amount that was 
automatically transferred from savings to cover an overdraft on the EYH account. The motion 
was withdrawn so that Susana can have a chance to ponder the last couple of months' bank 
statements.
</p>

<p><b>RESIGNATION:</b><BR>Carol Hogsett has resigned from LAWIS. Janie has been in contact with Cathy 
Majerus to fill this position. Janie will make sure Cathy is a member.
</p>
<p><b>MEMBERSHIP:</b><BR> Susana will write a check to NMNWSE for a complimentary membership for Kathleen 
Ramsay; Cathy Cleland will fill out the membership form and send it in with the check.
</p>

<p><b>Claim for Burned Careers Books and Bags:</b><BR>While we wait for the 
US Park Service to handle our claim, the state organization will contact our 
EYH donors and ask them to give us money to replace the books.
</p>

<p><b>BYLAWS:</b><BR>Mary Campbell will send the By-Laws revisions to the Steering Committee members as an attach
ment on e-mail.
</p>


<p><b>MISCELLANEOUS:</b><BR>Angelique gave a state meeting report. The 2000 annual meeting will be Oct 
20­22 in Ruidoso.
</p>
<p>The noontime speaker Alyssa Olson was introduced by Laura 
Wolfsberg and Tim Callahan both of E-ET. </p>
<p>Cathy says the LAWIS Web site may not be up to date for a while, but she's working on it. Update (06/14/00): we are ready to roll! (-CC)

<h3><A name=go></a>RESCHEDULED EVENTS</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, there are a lot of rescheduled meetings.  Here's the latest I've received:
</p>

<p>Georgia Pedicini tells us, "The Pay Equity Coalition, which almost certainly includes 
somebody (else) from LAWIS, had an information booth and a speaker scheduled 
for the first week were closed. The information booth is tentatively rescheduled
 for June 15th. That particular speaker will not be rescheduled, but we may 
bring someone in later in the summer."

   <ul>
      <li><b>Alyssa Olson</b>, EES-5, LANL, "Modeling Flow and Radionuclide Transport at the Western Pahute M
esa Area of the Nevada Test Site" <font color=red><b>Tuesday, June 13, 2000</b></font>, 11:30 am - 1:30 pm, Otowi cafeteri
a side room C, LANL, TALK at 12:00: <br>
<b>ABSTRACT</b>: At Pahute Mesa on the Nevada Test Site, a small amount of 
plutonium was recently detected 1.3 km from its source, the BENHAM underground 
nuclear test. This observation is critical because it illustrates a gap in our 
current understanding of the mobility of plutonium in groundwater, previously 
considered immobile because of its chemical properties. The plutonium was found 
in two aquifers, a lava formation at about the same elevation as the detonation 
point and a welded tuff formation 600 m above the detonation point, separated 
by a low permeability zeolitized tuff. In both locations, the plutonium was 
associated with colloid particles, particles 50 to 500 1/4m in size. To study 
and understand the conditions that led to this colloid-facilitated transport of 
plutonium, we have developed a modeling strategy that consists of the 
subregional groundwater flow system and reactive transport processes associated 
with fractured rock. We are developing a subregional-scale (8 km by 10.4 km) 
flow model to investigate the influence of complex geologic features and 
hydrologic parameters on the magnitude and direction of ground water flow 
through the areas between the BENHAM source and wells in which plutonium was 
observed. Within the subregional-scale domain, we have embedded a site-scale
(2.6 km by 3.2 km) domain containing the BEHNAM test area and the observation
 site, where the spatial distribution of hydrogeologic properties such as 
permeability and porosity can be varied at the 50 m scale. This high-resolution 
domain helps us to evaluate the impact of spatial variability in the transport 
models. Further, at an even finer scale near the source, we are evaluating 
thermal convective transport as the major mechanism for the movement of 
plutonium up and out of the nuclear test chimney/cavity system into the 
two separate aquifers. This mechanism is critical for explaining how plutonium 
was found above a low permeability tuff aquitar. Once the plutonium has 
reached the welded tuff and the lava aquifers, chemical modeling of diffusion, 
sorption and plutonium-colloid interactions are considered. We are integrating 
all of these components into a total system analysis tool for future risk 
assessment by the DOE and the state of Nevada. Nonmembers Welcome!

      <li><b>Lisa Gutierrez</b>, the director of the Laboratory's Diversity Office, 
"TEAMING FOR SUCCESS: The Power of Diversity." This talk has been rescheduled 
for <font color=red><b>Wednesday, June 28, 2000</b></font> at the Otowi Cafeteria Side room A & B. This talk will 
focus on a number of things:  How is the DVO defining Diversity?  Where does 
diversity fit within LANL and other strategies?  How does diversity link to 
core work of the lab?  Personal Sharing: Lisa's diversity learning and examples; 
and lastly, How to become a "cultural consumer."  This talk is jointly sponsored 
by the American Association of University Women (AAUW). Siderooms A & B are 
reserved from 11:30 to 1:30 for people who like to eat earlier or later, and 
informal discussion. You are welcome to come for just the talk at noon, and 
questions are encouraged!

      <li><b>Rose Barrientes de Scott</b>, Public Affairs/Legislative Liaison, 
"WASTE ISOLATION PILOT PLANT: Environmentally Safe Nuclear Waste Disposal," 
<font color=red><b>Wednesday, July 12, 2000</b></font>, at the Otowi Side Room C.  The slide presentation introduces 
the group to WIPP.  What, Where and Why is WIPP so important?  It outlines 
the truck route, the safety involved and truck monitoring.  Question and 
Answer at the end.
