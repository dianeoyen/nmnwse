<P><A NAME=pres></A>PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE -------------------

<P>Happy Summer to Members and Friends of Los Alamos Women in
Science! I enjoyed seeing many of you at the annual picnic.

<P>Our next big event in Northern Chapter is election of our FY 1998
Officers and Steering Committee. The Nominating Committee will be
searching for candidates and I know that we have many potential
leaders within our membership. We will be looking for candidates for
President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer, as well as
candidates to replace 5 of our 10 Steering Committee members.

<P>Then comes the annual meeting. I hope all of you have received or
have seen a copy of the "Call for Papers" and that many of you are
planning to present a paper to the membership at our meeting in Las
Cruces in mid October. Even if you aren't planning to present a
paper, please plan to attend, as it is a networking opportunity
without equal for women scientists in New Mexico.

<P>Last, but not least, I want to thank Tinka Gammel for her efforts
-- and successes -- in providing us with stimulating noon-time
programs on a regular basis. We have more of them to look forward to,
and I hope many of you can take the time to join us in learning and
discussing wide-ranging topics.

<P><A NAME=annual></A>NMNWSE ANNUAL MEETING / CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------------------------------

<P>The NMNWSE 1997 Annual Meeting will be in Las Cruces this year,
Oct. 17-19. For more information see the NMNWSE web page at
http://ladmac.lanl.gov/nmnwse/nmnwse.html, or contact dede Collins,
dede@lanl.gov. The purpose of the Symposium is to provide a forum for
women in New Mexico, to share their work through presentations and
technical discussions in a safe, friendly environment, to promote
career development, and to conduct the business of the Network.
Abstracts of 200 words or less for the technical presentations (20
minutes or less) should be submitted by August 29, 1997 to
NMNWSE/Karen Saenz, 2909 Hopi Trail, Alamogordo, NM 88310
(saenzk@wsmr.army.com). All topics and fields are welcome. Your
participation is essential to the success of the symposium.

<P><A NAME=picnic></A>NOTES FROM THE LAWIS PICNIC
---------------------------

<P>While attendance was not as great as we hoped, the weather and
food were! It was a lot of fun seeing old friends and meeting new
people -- there was even someone foolish enough to volunteer to give
one of the lunch-talks ("next spring"....). Having a vegetarian
entree was greatly appreciated by those who choose not to eat meat,
and so I recommend we make this a permanent feature of the picnic.

<P>Suggestions for next year's picnic are always welcome, and can be
given to any board member. The next general get-together is
tentatively a winter party in December or January. I hope to see you
there!

<P><A NAME=lunch></A>NOTES FROM THE LAWIS LUNCH TALKS
--------------------------------

<P>We had an animated crowd for Michelle Thomsen's very interesting
talk about "Space Weather" on May 20. I was happy to see several new
faces. Michelle said a good starting point to understand what "Space
Weather" means is the web site http://www.nas.edu/ssb/what.html I
checked this out and I agree with Michelle: very informative!
Michelle is happy to answer any questions you might have about space
weather. For those of you without web access, my summary (so blame
me, not Michelle, for errors) of her talk: "Space weather is the
phenomena occurring in the highly ionized region of space affected by
the solar wind and the magnetic fields of the earth -- typically in,
but not restricted to, the magnetosphere. Space weather focuses on
phenomena around the earth, but similar conditions are of course
expected around any planet with magnetic fields. Space weather --
"space fog", "space thunderstorms", "space tornados", etc (various
levels of electromagnetic activity such as aurora and radio
disturbances) -- is of concern because (a) geosynchronous satellites
orbit in the most dynamic part of the magnetosphere (b) ionic storms
affect local communications (c) currents in oil pipelines can be
caused by space weather, leading to greater rates of corrosion (d)
cosmic radiation reaching earth is affected by space weather,
arguably with biologic implications (the last in response to a
question). We already know that since solar flares causing space
weather are correlated with sunspot activity, there is a 22 yr cycle
(the sunspot cycle actually is twice the 11 yr number one usually
hears cited.) Also, the sun shows the same face to the earth every 27
days, leading to a 27 day period in space weather disturbances. The
military estimates the effect of space weather in terms of disrupted
communications, false alarms on spy satellites, etc, costs the US a
half billion dollars a year. There is now a multiagency program being
started to enable prediction of space weather in 10 yrs."

<P>As several people had expressed an interest in hearing the
presentations given at past Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) workshops,
besides Michelle's "Space Weather" talk I was able to "arm twist"
several of the DNA presenters (Kieran Cloud, Tracy Ruscetti, Susan
Bailey, Sue Thompson, and Carolyn Bell-Prince) into agreeing to give
brief versions of their EYH talks to LAWIS on June 18. We had to make
do without without any DNA samples to take home -- but that didn't
prevent us from walking out with our own! Unfortunately I had no
desire to work with messy living things when in school (I stuck with
nice, clean, controllable math and theoretical physics), so Susan
Bailey, who presented at EYH and was scheduled to speak to LAWIS but
had a last minute conflict, directed me to an excellent web site with
a primer on Molecular genetics:
http://www.bis.med.jhmi.edu/Dan/DOE/intro.html I checked it out and
it seems quite readable: a good introduction including glossary if
you are interested in learning a bit about the genome project. In
Carolyn Bell-Prince's part of the presentation she showed pictures of
the chromosomes of various animals. I had always thought that the
chromosomes of most animals are roughly the same size, and that "more
advanced" animals have more chromosomes. I was quite fascinated to
learn that this is not generally true: dogs, for instance, have
nearly twice as many chromosomes as humans. (Maybe "Prof. Peabody and
his boy Sherman" wasn't so far off?) There are even closely related
animals whose DNA looks very different. Carolyn showed the example of
an Asian deer, the Muntjac, which has only 7 chromosomes, but each
about 10 times (!) as large as a human chromosome. Most deer have
"standard looking" chromosomes (about 10x as many "normal size"
ones): apparently for some reason the Muntjac "put all its base pairs
in one basket", so to say: strange. Anyway it was a fun bunch of
talks and helped me understand a bit more about how we know how
living things live.

<P>In my desperate search to find people willing to spend long hours
preparing a talk for a very small (but enthusiastic!) audience, I was
lucky to chance upon Dolores Montano, who has supplied me with
several excellent leads for speakers. On July 11 Dolores give her
view of how the first ``Expanding Your Horizons", held at the College
of Santa Fe, came to be, along with the history of how WIS was born.
Dolores showed several historic photos and clippings and I got a much
better picture of the history of this organization. Dolores has also
been very active encouraging students to come to the talks, and I am
happy to report that our typical audience has more than tripled since
the first talks this spring, though since many of the summer students
have left I expect these numbers to "fall in the fall".

<P>While organizing Dolores' talk, I got a call from Howard Vasquez
of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Santa Fe Information Center
asking if LAWIS would be interested in hearing a presentation on
WIPP. The email response was positive, so I asked Howard to give a
brief talk following Dolores' talk. Since there was little time to
get out an announcement, and there was enough interest, Howard gave a
repeat presentation on July 29. Howard gave a very good presentation
and didn't mind too much that we hassled him for giving an entire
talk on WIPP without once using the words "nuclear" or "radiation".
For those of you who missed the talk but are interested in finding
out more about WIPP, Howard left a few copies of their public
information packet with me. Call or email me if you'd like one. We
may also organize a trip to see the WIPP site (located near Carlsbad,
NM) -- see the latest talk announcement for more details. Among the
many interesting tidbits, we learned the rooms where the waste is to
be stored shrink by about 3"/yr due to the pressure of the
overburdening rock -- this is used as a design feature and will
eventually lead to the waste containers being sealed in by the salt.
As an appreciation for letting him speak to us, Howard sent a bunch
of "WIPP" sport-bands (or whatever they are called) for securing
glasses. I will pass them out at the Sept. 4 talk by Carol Mooney.

<P>On August 1, Kaye Karns spoke on "Osmium isotopic separation and
strategies to eliminate exposures" which she gave at a recent
conference in her field. Kaye started with a brief introduction to
what an Industrial Hygienist does (quoting from the brochure Kaye
handed out): "Industrial Hygienists are scientists and engineers
committed to protecting the health and safety of people in the
workplace and the community. Industrial Hygiene is considered a
science, but it also nvolves judgement, creativity, and human
interaction. The goal of the Industrial Hygienist is to keep the
workers, their families, and the community healthy and safe. They
play a vital part in insuring that federal, state, and local laws and
regulations are followed in the work environment." Kaye then went on
to describe a specific example of how she had worked with a group of
people at LANL investigating a new method of Osmium isotopic
separation to insure safety of the project. Airborn Osmium is
extremely hazardous but has a very distinctive odor (according to
workers at other institutions who had had mild exposures, which
incidents Kaye researched as background for this project). Part of
the final safety procedure Kaye developed was to stop and smell the
air upon entering the facility to determine if it was safe to
procede. Kaye also had to find out where the Osmium went that did not
reach the final collection stage. A significant fraction was trapped
in the vaccum pump oil. This did not present an immediate hazard as
the pump oil effectively acted as a storage container for the Osmium.
Further, the Osmium could be recovered from the pump oil at a later
date if desired (while the isotope of Osmium of interest to this
project was depleted in the Osmium trapped in the pump oil, the
recovered Osmium could potentially be resold to researchers with
other interests, significantly reducing the effective cost of the
isotope to this project). Thus no modification of the procedure was
made to prevent Osmium getting into the pump oil. Kaye also studied
if any vented Osmium could pose a hazard to pedestrians passing the
building, and the area around the exhaust air vent was cordoned off
to a safe distance as a result. Following Kaye's talk, she was
approached by one of the summer students attending who is interested
in entering this field, and Kaye was able to give a lot of good
advice. I was happy to see the "Old Girl's Network" in action!

------------------------------

<P>Denise George and Tinka Gammel spent a delightful evening at Taos
Ski Valley this June interacting with a collection of elementary
school teachers. We were invited by Edi Klinger who was running a
workshop on creative activities to encourage math and science
education in the primary grades. Also attending was a female Santa Fe
architect and one of the AAUW (American Association of University
Women) sponsors of the most recent Careers and Curiosity Project. We
were there to brainstorm the issue of girls losing interest in math
and science -- girls often decide it is 'not cool.' We presented the
Careers and Curiosity project which brings women who use math and
science in their careers into the schools as a potential resource to
be used by the elementary schools in Northern New Mexico. Women
scientists bring hands-on activities to the schools, and all students
have an opportunity to observe female scientists who are excited
about their careers. It is an exposure activity whose purpose is to
pique the children's natural curiosity.

STILL NEEDED
---------------------------------------------------------

<P>Help is still needed for the revision of the NMNWSE booklet
"Surveying Your Future: Nontraditional Careers for Young Women". It
is an important tool we use to inspire young women to enter science
and engineering fields and to give them information to help them make
career choices. While most of the career essays now have authors,
there are still tow topics for which no one has volunteered ("Paying
For Your Education"; "Sexual Stereotyping and Sexual Prejudice").
Also, the individual contributions will need to be edited into a
coherent whole.

<P>Date: Thu, 12 Jun 1997 From: Voter Education
&lt;VOTERED@mail.aauw.org&gt; Subject: Get the Facts--June 12

<P>Get the Facts June 12, 1997

<P>Title IX: 25 Years of Breaking Down Barriers For Women &amp; Girls

<P>In 1972, Congress enacted Title IX, the law that prohibits sex
discrimination in education. In the 25 years since its passage, Title
IX has helped women and girls make strides in gaining access to
higher education, athletics, and nontraditional fields of study.

<P>- In 1972 women made up 44 percent of undergraduates; today women
are 55 percent. - In 1971 girls made up 1% of high school varsity
athletes; today they make up 40%. - Until Title IX, many high schools
prohibited girls from taking certain courses, such as auto mechanics
and criminal justice. - In 1970 women earned 0.7% of bachelor's
degrees in engineering; in 1994 women earned 14.8% of these degrees.
- In 1970 women earned 7.1 percent of law degrees and 9.1 percent of
medical degrees; in 1994 women earned 43 percent and 38 percent of
degrees in those fields.

<P>As women, girls, and their families across the country celebrate
the 25th anniversary of Title IX, barriers to equality in education
remain. Some obstacles that block women's and girls' access to the
best education possible include:

<P>- 85% of girls report experiencing sexual harassment at school. -
Women's college athletics programs receive only 25% of athletic
budgets. - According to the National Assessment of Education
Progress, female students' participation rates in math and science
decline as they advance in higher education.

<P>Parents and educators must continue to address these barriers in
order to ensure that women and girls can be successful in their
lives.

<P>Here's What You Can Do!

<P>Help spread the word; work with friends to distribute this alert
in your community.

<P>Call your senators and representative at 202/224-3121 and urge
them to support strong enforcement of Title IX so that all doors to
educational opportunities are open to women and girls.
