<h3><a name=min></a>STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING MINUTES-PARTIAL</h3>
<p>Well, folks, the last Steering Committee meeting took place on April 13, 2000, but the committ
ee ran out of time and didn't get to discuss all the issues on the table.  We did schedule a f
ollow-up meeting for Thursday, April 27th.  However, the minutes from both meetings won't be f
inalized until May 11th.  You can look for them on the LAWIS website and in the June issue of 
the newsletter.   Meanwhile, here's the draft  - emphasize - DRAFT - version of the minutes fr
om the April 13th discussion.  You'll notice some pretty interesting topics, including proper 
use of the LAWIS listserver, as well as suggestions for recognizing pay equity champions at LA
NL.</p>

<p><b>MINUTES:</b><BR>The Steering Committee for Los Alamos Women in Science met Thursday,
4/13/00 at 7:00 a.m., at the back of the cafeteria. Members present were Cathy Cleland, 
Ann Mauzy, Janie Enter, Mary Campbell, Dana Roberson, and Margo Clark. 
Members absent were Susana Delano, Dolores Monta&#241;o, Laura McNamara, 
Huyen Dinh, and Angelique Neuman. We were joined by Tinka Gamel, Gloria 
Mirabal, Amy Meilander, and Mary Gentry.
</p>

<p><b>LAWIS Listserv:</b><BR>Janie reported steps taken to discourage/prevent abuse of the 
listserv and the fallout from the Million Mom March for Gun Control posting. 
Tinka Gamel and visitors Amy Meilander and Mary Gentry form CIC-5, mail 
management joined the discussion. We don't want to censor e-mail posted to 
the listserv. The CIC-5 representative said as long as we follow LAB/DOE 
waste, fraud, and abuse guidelines, we are OK. However, they cautioned, 
<b>"Think before you hit send."</b> If you aren't sure, get a second 
opinion. "If it's a politically charged, controversial topic, avoid it." 
Tinka added, "Be sure you know who you are replying to; don't reply to 'all' 
if you don't intend to." Guidelines for the Web will be up in the next 
couple of weeks. There are already guidelines on spam. Janie will circulate 
new guidelines and the URL when they are available.
</p>
<p>Tinka asked if we could restrict the list to LANL plus our members outside of LANL. It's not  
practical. She asked if we could filter out words and have a default list. I didn't get the fi
nal  answer. (Tinka, help) Mail Manager will keep in touch with Tinka.
Pay Equity Coalition/Janet Wing Recognition - Gloria Mirabal defined the Pay Equity Coalition,
 which seeks to raise awareness of the issue of pay equity between men and women. The Coalitio
n includes Employee Advisory Committee, Women's Diversity Working Group, AAUW, Business and Pr
ofessional Women, and others. The chairman is Mary Barr. There will be a speaker from Weiser C
orp. May 11 at the MSL Conference Room during the lunch hour talking about helping women plan 
for their retirement. The Coalition in partnership with Mana del Norte will do a workshop in E
spa$#241;ola with this speaker also.
</p>
<p>Gloria asked us to do something to honor Janet Wing for her efforts to help with pay equity at
 the Lab. Janet headed a class-action suit, which took years in the 1980s, that resulted in mo
re pay equity for women at LANL. Pay equity rules were subsequently added to the LANL Admin.  
Manual. She proposed that we do something, "even if it's a plaque or a certificate" and sugges
ted the LANL talk May 11 would be a good place to do so. Gloria's number is 672-3094.
The discussion then turned on whether labor unions at the Lab made things different vis-`-vis 
what we could champion or not. We affirmed that we are a separate organization from LANL, a ch
apter of a statewide organization. Margo will take two related questions to the state board me
eting on Saturday, April 15: Would NMNWSE join the Pay Equity Coalition? Would they lend their
 name to the plaque (Ann will word it).
Proposed wording for the Janet Wing plaque:
</P>

<blockquote><B><I>
LAWIS, The Northern Chapter of the New Mexico Network for Women in Science and Engineering 
(NMNWSE) recognizes Janet Wing for her contributions to all  women in science and 
for serving as a valuable and inspiring mentor to other women throughout her 
career.</I></B>
</blockquote>

<p>
We decided we couldn't do it as a LANL organization but could do it as a non-LANL plaque to be
 purchased from membership money. The only financial connection between LAWIS and LANL is the 
internal money used for EYH.
A motion was passed to come up with a plaque to honor Janet Wing for her contributions to wome
n in science. Janie will check on the cost of doing a Nambi plaque.
We asked ourselves what we could to support pay equity, and we will ask for guidance from the 
state.
</p>

<p><b>BYLAWS:</b><BR>Nice segue to the by-laws discussion. Mary can put a statement 
in the by-laws clarifying the LAWIS/LANL relationship. The new draft will go 
to the state leadership to see if it is OK or if anything is lacking. All 
"WIS" will be changed to "LAWIS." It appears that the changes presently being 
made are revisions to update the existing document, not to add amendments. 
We talked about whether we had to put in an amendment about unions and 
decided to add a LAWIS/LANL clarification instead. But later we decided that 
since we are not a LANL organization, we didn't need to add the clarification.
</p>
<p>
If we are merely making revisions to the existing document, a simple majority 
vote will be sufficient to approve them. If we are adding amendments, a 2/3 
majority is necessary. We talked about how to circulate and vote for the 
revised by-laws with a combination of mail and e-mail.
</p>
<p><b>MISCELLANEOUS:</b><BR> Margo will clarify if NMNWSE is also a part of the 
Math and Science Network. We also talked about replacing Steering Committee 
members who do not attend meetings.  It being 8:30, the remainder of the 
discussion was tabled until Thursday, April 27, same time,  same place. 
Please note this is IN ADDITION to the regularly scheduled meetings every 
second Thursday of the month.
</p>

<p>
<b>Calling All Web Experts:</b>Cathy and Tinka are looking for s
ome help setting up a voting system for the next LAWIS elections.  They are 
looking for someone with CGI or Java scripting skills, Perl and HTML.

<h3><A name=go></a>GOINGS-ON: TALKS, EVENTS, ETC.</h3>
<h3><a name=past></a>Past Events</h3>
<p><b>Careers And Curiosity At Espa&#241;ola Middle School A Big Hit!</b> Denise George kindly 
provided the following report on the Careers and Curiosity day held at 
Espa&#241;ola Middle School on April 11th, 2000. If you're on the LANL web, 
you can see some photos of the event at <a href="http://home.lanl.gov/dcg/CC/C+C2000-photos.html">
home.lanl.gov/dcg/CC/C+C2000-photos.html</a>. This was the first 
Careers and Curiosity in Math and Science held at a middle school. 
As the participants were older, we decided that a more structured format might 
work better.  We wanted to reach all 7th graders (~300) and since at this 
school there are three 7th grade science classes each period, we first thought 
that we would set up stations in the 3 classrooms.  The classes would rotate 
through the 3 rooms, spending about 15 minutes in each room.  As the date of 
the event approached, we realized that this would not give students enough 
time at each station, so we contacted the school to ask if we could have 2 
class periods instead of one.  This would allow the students more time at 
each station.   As the presenters are not teachers, we asked that the 
teachers rotate through the events with their students.  We also divided 
students into boy/girl subgroups where appropriate.  The parent organization 
supplied some parent volunteers and other volunteers came from the local 
American Association of University Women. </p>
<p>
<h4>The stations included: </h4>
<ol>
   <li><b>exploring with magnets</b> (three substations: levitation using magnets, 
magnet toys and kits, iron filings patterns) 
   <li><b>hydrology</b>  ( how does water flow through different soil types) 
   <li><b>radiation</b>  (radiation in some common objects) 
   <li><b>chemistry of foods</b> (testing for starch) 
   <li><b>microbiology</b>  (bacteria that glow under UV light) 
   <li><b>explosives</b> (safety, chemical structure of some explosives, 
deformation caused by explosives) 
   <li><b>geology</b> (two substations: volcanos and rocks that float, and rocks of 
the Jemez Mountains)
   <li><b>3D computer modeling</b> (building 3D grids consisting of 4 basic geometric shapes  using mars
hmallows and toothpicks) 
   <li><b>brain teaser toys</b> (puzzles involving topology and logic).
</ol>

The parent coordinator provided interface to the school administration, 
recruited parent volunteers, and took care of important details such as 
locking the rooms during lunch, providing snacks, traffic control.  Overall 
the event went very well.  The students were polite and engaged in the 
activities.  <b>However, we learned some important lessons:</b> 
<ol>
   <li>The rotation was not well worked out - for this format to succeed we 
should print out a schedule of time slots for each class at each activity.  
There should be an adult that rotates with each class and moves them along as 
appropriate.  The presenters should also have a  copy of the schedule and be 
aware of the time constraints. 
   <li>Lots of helpers are needed - each presenter needs a helper - the helpers can be other scientists, interested parents or volunteers from the community.  We also need a helper or two to 
meet presenters at the door - help them unload and take them to their stations.  A few roving 
helpers are needed to run errands, watch stations while presenters take a break, bring snacks 
etc.  The helpers we had were wonderful, but overworked! 
   <li>We need  a better way to separate stations - two or more stations in one room was noisy and distracting - separate rooms would be best but maybe portable blackboards with fabric draped
 over to absorb sound might work as a compromise.  In a school with wide hallways, halls could
 be used for some stations.  The presenter coordinator, parent coordinator and school coordinator should walk through the school early in the planning process, thinking creatively of spaces that might be used for this event. 
   <li>There should be a translator for non-English speaking students. 
   <li>Teachers should stay with their students.  The presenter should let the teacher know if he/she is invited to participate in the activity. 
</ol>

<h4>Here are a few more ideas to ponder: </h4>
<ol>
   <li>Fall might be better than spring, because it would encourage students to 
work diligently in their math and science classes for the rest of the school 
year. 
   <li>Other formats were suggested - scientists could set up one or two 
demos/activities in a science classroom and the students assigned to that 
science teacher would do the activities in that room.  In this school, for 
all students to have the same access, we would either have to find 3 scientists 
willing to do the same activity, or the scientist would have to be willing to 
come three days.  Alternatively we could have different activities in the 3 
science rooms and students would just have access to the activities in their 
science class. 
</ol>

<h3><a name=future></a>THINGS TO LOOK FORWARD TO: UPCOMING TALKS AND EVENTS</h3>
<p>
Remember: for all Lunchtime Talks, Sideroom C is open from 11:30-1:30 for an early 
or late lunch and socializing.  Nonmembers are invited join us, so bring a friend!
</p>

<b>Lunchtime Talk, Tuesday, May 9, 11:30am -1:30pm (talk at 12:00pm), Cochiti Room</b>, Study Center:
<br>
Lisa Gutierrez, Director of Diversity Office, LANL, "TEAMING FOR SUCCESS: 
The Power of Diversity." <b>ABSTRACT</b>: This talk will focus on a number of 
issues related to Diversity, including questions such as <b>A)</b> How is the DVO 
defining Diversity? <b>B)</b> Where does diversity fit within LANL and other 
strategies? <b>C)</b> How does diversity link to core work of the lab? <b>D)</b>     
Personal Sharing: Lisa's diversity learning and examples and E) how to 
become a "cultural consumer."  This talk is jointly sponsored by the 
American Association of University Women (AAUW). As we usually
 do with the Otowi Siderooms, the Cochiti room is reserved from 11:30 to 
1:30 for people who like to eat earlier or later, and informal discussion. 
You are welcome to come for just the talk at noon.  Questions are encouraged!
</p>

<p>
<b>The Los Alamos Pay Equity Coalition (MANA de Norte, AAUW, BPW, LWV, EAC, 
WDWG and members at large)</b> invites you to attend some pay equity events 
scheduled for May 10 and May 11.  On Wednesday, May 10, the Coalition will 
host an information booth at the Otowi Cafeteria to distribute information 
about the importance of pay equity for women.  On May 11, we will host a 
presentation by Cindy Hunsel from WISER (Women's Institute for a Secure 
Retirement) during the noon hour at the Material Science Laboratory (MSL) 
conference room (Conf. room is not in a classified area).  The conference 
room is on the East side of the road at the Sigma Road stop light on Diamond 
Drive.  Snacks will be provided at the presentation. At the May 11 
presentation, representatives from Women in Science will present a plaque to 
former LANL mathematician Janet Wing whose work and efforts led to the hiring 
and advancement of female scientists at the Laboratory.  We would like as 
many women there as possible to show our appreciation to her.   On the evening 
of May 10, MANA del Norte has scheduled a no-host dinner at Angelina's 
Restaurant in Espa&#241;ola where Cindy Hunsel will again speak to women from 
the community on the importance of saving and investing for their retirement.  
The public is invited to attend.  Dinner is at 6:00 (order from the menu), 
the presentation will be from 7:00 to 9:00.  You are invited to join us for 
all or part of this program. At the Espa&#241;ola event Cindy will cover how social 
security plays a part in your overall retirement planning, whereas at the Lab 
presentation, social security will not be stressed as much.  This is probably 
the biggest difference in the two talks. Please pass this information to as 
many people as possible. I look forward to see you at these events.  If you 
have questions call Gloria Mirabal at 672-3094.
