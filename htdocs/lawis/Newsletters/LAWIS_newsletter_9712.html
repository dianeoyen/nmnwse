<HR> <H3><A NAME=pres></A>PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE</H3>

<P>I'd like to begin by thanking the outgoing Board Members, and
welcoming the new Board Members: I look forward to working with you.
Work has already begun on our main activity for the year, hosting the
"Expanding Your Horizons" Workshop, and I encourage all members to
think about helping. The commitee updating the "Surveying Your
Future, nontraditional careers for young women" booklet has been
making progress and I look forward to seeing the revised version. As
your new President, I am open to suggestions to make LAWIS a better
organization to meet the needs of the membership: please let me know
your ideas!

<HR> <H3><A NAME=party>HOLIDAY CHEER!!</H3>

<P>For those of you who missed the holiday party, 
Ann Mauzy sends the following "Holiday Cheer":<BR>

<P>THE NIGHT BEFORE DEFENCE (or A Visit From Citrate)<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Twas the night before defence, when all through the lab<BR>
   Not a gel box was shaking, with stain or with MAb;<BR>
   The columns were hung in the cold room with care,<BR>
   In hopes that my protein, I soon could prepare;<BR>
<P>The post-docs were nestled all smug in their beds,<BR>
   While extracts of barley muddled their heads;<BR>
   With the tech in the suburbs and PI the same,<BR>
   I had just settled down to another video game.<BR>
<P>When out of the fridge there arose such a clatter<BR>
   I sprang from the terminal to see what was the matter.<BR>
   Away to the cold box, I flew like a flash<BR>
   But the stench was o'erpowering and I threw up beef hash.<BR>
<P>The mould on the dampest of walls which were cold<BR>
   Had the softness of kittens only seven weeks old;<BR>
   When what to my view, a thing I despise<BR>
   But a half eaten sandwich and four tiny mice;<BR>
<P>With a little old scientist, so lively and galling,<BR>
   I knew at a glance was Linus Pauling.<BR>
   More vapid than undergrads, his charges they came,<BR>
   And he whistled, and shouted, and called them rude names.<BR>
<P>"Now, Watson! Now Francis! You strange little modellers!<BR>
   On Luria! On Bertani! You stupid old broth'lers!<BR>
   To the top of the bench, to the top of the wall!<BR>
   Purify! Purify! Purify all!"<BR>
<P>As dry heaves before the commitee meeting, bend<BR>
   A young student's body and his colon distend,<BR>
   So up their earlobes, acytes they grew,<BR>
   With a sack full of antibodies, their skin turning blue.<BR>
<P>And then, for a second, I heard from the 'fuge,<BR>
   An unbalanced rotor spinning something too huge.<BR>
   Where I put down my hand, to better hear the sound,<BR>
   Came the snapping of sparks from a wire sans ground.<BR>
<P>Pauling's hair was all wavy, and I thought I must be sick<BR>
   `Cause the curl in his hair looked just like a helix.<BR>
   On an arm load of oranges, he started to snack<BR>
   An I recalled his fetish with citrate, the quack.<BR>
<P>His eyes were all wrinkled, but the cheeks were yet red;<BR>
   Not too shabby for a man who was several years dead;<BR>
   The leer of his smile was just a tad scary<BR>
   And the snow on his rooftop made his head yet quite hairy;<BR>
<P>The end of a pipette, he held in his teeth<BR>
   And a pile of kimwipes lay around his big feet.<BR>
   He held a small vial of something quite gel-ly,<BR>
   A mercaptan no doubt, for it make him quite smelly.<BR>
<P>He changed `round the columns, adding to the confusion<BR>
   And I laughed to spite my own paranoid delusion.<BR>
   A wink of his eye and a rotation of his head,<BR>
   Told me whatever I drank would soon leave me dead.<BR>
<P>He spoke not a word, just buggered up my work,<BR>
   And dried all my resins, that silly old jerk.<BR>
   And separating his middle finger from first, fourth and third,<BR>
   That crazy, old bugger, just flipped me the bird.<BR>
<P>He grabbed up his cohorts and ran down the hall,<BR>
   And away they all flew, letting me take the fall.<BR>
   That is why, dear Committee, I am sorry to say,<BR>
   I need a five year extension, starting today.<BR>

<HR> <H3><A NAME=survey></A>SURVEYING YOUR FUTURE BOOKLET REVISION: GET
YOUR ARTICLES IN!!</H3>

<P>The committee updating the "Surveying Your Futures" booklet, which
NMNWSE distributes to middle and high school girls to encourage them
to consider a career in science, is working hard to get the new
edition out. Ann Mauzy (mauzy@lanl.gov, 7-5387), the LAWIS
coordinator for this NMNWSE project, reports that, although we have
volunteers for every topic, some volunteers have not come through
yet.

<P>IF YOU HAVE PROMISED TO UPDATE ONE OF THE ARTICLES, AND YOU HAVE
NOT YET DONE IT, YOU'D BETTER HOP ON IT OR A "DESIGNATED NAGGER" WILL
BE AFTER YOU!!!

<P>Seriously, the drop-dead date is Jan 9, and if an author cannot
make that date, PLEASE let Ann know so that the article can be
re-assigned.

<HR> <H3><A NAME=eyh></A>EYH KICKOFF MEETING JANUARY 7</H3>

<P>The annual Expanding Your Horizons Conference for 8-10 grade girls
in Northern NM is scheduled for Wednesday, March 25 at the Study
Center at LANL.

<P>Joyce Ann Guzik (joy@lanl.gov, 7-8927) and Alexine Salazar
(alexine@lanl.gov, 7-1785) are co-chairs this year. The kickoff
meeting is January 7, 11:30-1:00, in the E228 Conference Room in the
Otowi bldg at LANL (beneath the cafeteria).

<P>Please attend the meeting or contact the co-chairs if you are
interested in helping: everything from workshop presenters to fund
raisers to "go-fers" are need. This is a very rewarding experience!

<P align="right"><a href="#contents">back to top</a>
<HR> <H3><A NAME=annual></A>1997 NMNWSE ANNUAL MEETING AND TECHNICAL
SYMPOSIUM</H3>

<P>The NMNWSE Annual meeting was held on October 17-19, 1997, at the
Vancouver Suites in Las Cruces. The first 3 talks in the Technical
Symposium were presented from 4 to 7 pm on Friday evening. We met at
8:00 the next morning for the Annual Meeting and then listened to 7
more talks, with a break for lunch during which we heard Dr. Mary
O'Connell speak on "Bio-Informatics, What is it?" The afternoon
included a tour of the brand new Farm &amp; Ranch Museum at NMSU (not
quite open to the public). The Symposium Dinner was held at Meson de
Mesilla where the dinner speaker was Donna Eichstaedt who spoke on
"The Role Women Played at WSMR." The bimonthly Board of Directors
meeting was held on Sunday morning and we were finished before noon.

<P>We heard some excellent talks ranging from "Science Education in
New Mexico in the 21st Century" to "Genetic Diversity of Populations
Isolated by Climate Change." Two of the speakers from Los Alamos were
Angelique Neuman on "Adhesion Testing of Erbium Oxide Coatings" and
Jennifer Roper on "High Temperature Superconductors: Ion-Beam
Assisted Deposition of Biaxially Aligned Template Films of YSZ for
Long Length Coated Conductors." It was a very satisfying conference,
from my perspective. We had a good turn-out and "networked" with
women from many fields.

<P>PS: The state officers for this year are: Kelly Bitner, president
Karen Saenz, vice president/president elect Jennifer Siders,
Secretary Deborah Kubicek, Treasurer Lynda Towers, past NMNWSE
president

<HR> <H3><A NAME=lunch></A>NOTES FROM THE LAWIS LUNCH TALKS</H3>

<P>Tentatively scheduled to speak in January and February at the
LAWIS Lunch-Time Talk Series are Laura Kraemer and Ann Pendergrass.
I'll be sending announcements for their talks as soon as the dates
are set. I am sure they will be very good talks and look forward to
seeing you all there!

<P>The planned trip in October to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant
(WIPP) near Carlsbad, with a side trip to see Trinity site,
unfortunately had to be cancelled. We are going to try again on April
3-4 (since Trinity site is only open 2 days a year - the first
Saturday in April and October). I am definitely going as that date is
my (egad!!) 40th birthday and somehow is seems fitting to spend it
looking at a dump and where something blew up.... Seriously: we have
reports that it is a pretty good tour, so mark this date on your
calendar: I'll begin arranging the trip about mid-March. I still have
a few copies of the WIPP brochure Howard Vasquez of the Santa Fe WIPP
Information Center handed out. If anyone is interested in looking at
them, let me know and I'll be happy to stick a copy in the mail.

<P>On September 4, Carol Mooney, at the time GRA representative at
LANL, gave an excellent talk on "Changes and Challenges in Science
Careers". Carol first got interested in science as a career when she
saw pictures of geologists rafting the Grand Canyon in high school.
(She has yet to do it herself though....) She also did some teaching
of sixth graders while in high school and discovered she loved
teaching. She took a geology major in college. In those days
geology=oil, and she worked for an oil company for 5 years. But with
the end of the "windfall profit" days, the job market collapsed. She
saw an opportunity in making maps (before the days of Computer Aided
Design; CAD), which she did as a private contractor and became quite
successful. Computer technology rapidly advanced, and she decided to
go back and pursue her love of teaching before CAD made her map
making career obsolete. She got a masters degree in teaching. She
taught for a while, including high school geology in Los Alamos, and
then was selected for the SERS program and discovered that the life
of a teacher was pretty hard compared to a LANL scientist. (This
program has since been cancelled as none of it's graduates have
returned to teaching as they all discovered this same truth -- an
unfortunate commentary on the value our society places on arguably
the most important profession for the future of mankind.) She also
did an NSF program in Montana where she "taught teachers" and lead
field trips, but found she missed the mountains so went back to teach
at Los Alamos. However, they had hired a new geology teacher and
wanted her to teach biology. Rather than not use her skills, she took
advantage of the opportunity to run the GRA program program at LANL.
Carol emphasized that one should be aware of other opportunities and
not hesitate to take them when they come along, even if it means a
career change.

<P>On October 2, Denise George of T-1 at LANL gave a most enjoyable
talk to LAWIS on "Managing a Software Team". Denise began her career
in computers as the field was desperate for people, even though she
had no experience in the field. The emphasis of the time was "codes,
codes, codes". Denise soon realized that she needed a Master's degree
if she was going to be allowed to do anything fun. Things had also
changed and "women were being hired to do interesting things".
However, family intervened so she stayed home for a while, but found
this was not for her. She then took a job managing a database on
cows, where she learned among other things the role of the "clean-up
bull" &#91;I'm sure you can fill in the details...&#93;. With the
birth of ther second child she again tried her "other career", i.e.
"Mom", full time, but quickly went back to work doing data displays
part time &#91;"in the days before Mac's", Denise emphasized...&#93;
In this job she learned about reactor fuel histories, doing both
graphics and support codes. T-2 at LANL was very cooperative about
letting her work part time to take care of her family. (They hired
her when she was 7 months pregnant!) Times changed again, as they
have a way of doing, and Denise found herself looking for something
new. The CRADA on numerical grid generation was looking for someone
to manage the software team, and Denise was able to fill the bill.
The team is large in the sense of the number of divisions and
interests involved rather than in the the number of people. Denise
has learned that with scientists, one needs to coordinate more than
manage, and that people respond to different stimuli. If you can get
them to "buy in" then everything will go OK, though some people still
require more prodding than others... It is a diplomatic challenge
requiring "more than the carrot but not just the stick".

<P>Denise's wise words about carrots and sticks remind me: I am
looking for more "volunteers" to speak at LAWIS Lunch-Time Talks in
the Spring. I'll try and avoid leaving a trail back to you if you
send me names of gullible victims ....

<HR> <H3><A NAME=mentor></A>COMPUTING MENTORS NEEDED</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Date: Sat, 13 Dec 1997 From: Celia Einhorn
   &lt;celia@silicon-desert.com&gt;
   
   <P>Friends,
   
   <P>Betsy Frederick and I are working with NM Technet with the NM
   High School Supercomputing Challenge and we need several kinds of
   mentors.
   
   <P>First:
   
   <P>Is there anyone out there who would be willing to be an online
   mentor for Fortran. What is that some of you young people might
   ask? We already have mentors for UNIX, C++, HTML, JAVA and just
   hoping that someone out there would place their email for students
   in NM would confer with them about Fortran. You may not get much
   business, but we need that angle covered. Please email me if you
   are interested.
   
   <P>Second:
   
   <P>45 Supercomputing Advisors Needed
   
   <P>Welcome to the 8th Annual New Mexico High School Supercomputing
   Challenge -- "a program in which student teams and their
   sponsoring teachers work on supercomputers to solve scientific
   problems."
   
   <P>Since the inception of the program in 1990, more than 3,800 New
   Mexico high school students and teachers have benefitted from
   participation.
   
   <P>The Challenge is both a learning experience and a competition.
   Through workshops, educational materials, and the help of
   technical support resources, students and teachers are exposed to
   hands-on scientific problem solving. Teams that make significant
   progress on their projects can compete for awards of savings bonds
   and scholarships for individuals, computer equipment for the
   schools, and trophies for teams.
   
<P>This year, the executive committee is focusing on getting each
team an advisor. Please check out the role of advisor at
<a href="http://www.technet.nm.org/challenge/challenge_details.html#roleadvisor">
http://www.technet.nm.org/challenge/challenge_details.html#roleadvisor</a>
   
   <P>Check out the teams' abstracts at <A HREF="http://mode.lanl.k12.nm.us/97.98/abstracts">http://mode.lanl.k12.nm.us/97.98/abstracts</A>
   Find the ones who still need an advisor and if that is in your
   area, please volunteer. Please contact the teacher through email
   or phone and find out how you can help. The executive committe
   believes that your input will help more teams complete their work.
   
   <P>Our regional meetings are coming up in January. We need people
   to join us at the Meet the Scientist Luncheons to help our teams
   with project design. The regionals are as follows:
   
   <P>- Tuesday, January 13, Eastern, Portales - Thursday, January
   15, NMSU, Cruces - Friday, January 16, Tech, Socorro - Monday,
   January 26, San Juan, Farmington - Wednesday, January 28, UNM,
   Alb. - Friday, January 30, Highlands, Las Vegas
   
   <P>Please contact consult@mode.lanl.k12.nm.us, if you have any
   questions, to let us know what teams are covered and which
   regional session you can attend for lunch.
   
   <P>When you volunteer your time, please register as an advisor for
   the Challenge at <A HREF="http://www.technet.nm.net/cgi-bin/noauth/prod/chal97/req_rec.cgi/advisor">http://www.technet.nm.net/cgi-bin/noauth/prod/chal97/req_rec.cgi/advisor</A>

<HR> <H3><A NAME=scholar></A>SCHOLARSHIP/EDUCATION RESOURCES</H3>

<P>You may recall some months ago I forwarded a request for
information about veterinary scholarships in NM. Summarized below are
the responses, should this question come up for any of you in the
future. I would like to thank all those who gave suggestions.

<P>-- Tinka

<P>Suggested Resources:

<OL>
   <LI>The WICHE (Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education)
   student exchange program at UNM Chris and Julie discuss in the
   next article was suggested, which is how I found out about the
   problems they have encountered there. (I urge you to consider
   writing your representative to express your opinion on this matter
   after reading their letter.) The WICHE program allows students
   interested in programs not offered at UNM to go to schools
   offering that program in the western region covered, and pay the
   same tuition. They also have scholarships available. Under the
   current guidelines, if you have a NM high-school diploma, and are
   interested in a program not offered at UNM, this may be worth
   pursuing.</LI>
   
   <LI>UNM-LA's Career Resource Center has a software program called
   Choices. This program provides current information on scholarships
   available from a number of sources in the US. There are two books
   in the reference section of the UNM-LA library. The first one is
   called the "Occupational Outlook Handbook," Call# REF HD5706.022
   1996-97. This book provides info. on the occupation and related
   data. The second is "The College Blue Book," Call # REF L901 .C685
   V5. This one gives about six scholarships awarded for this
   educational pursuit. Feel free to make an appointment for
   additional help at the Career Resource Center located in Building
   2 on the UNM-LA campus. Phone# 662-5919, ext. 202. --</LI>
   
   <LI>The career counseling center at the High School. (I do not
   know what the restrictions on access are for non-students.)</LI>
   
   <LI>The Sante Fe AAUW sponsors a small scholarship for graduate
   studies at UNM. To find out more about it the best place to start
   would probably be the UNM Grad School office. If it is of interest
   to you and you have trouble finding out about it, Nancy Scheer,
   nscheer@lanl.gov, is willing to help you track this down (it is
   not listed on the AAUW web page).</LI>
   
   <LI>Internet: various people suggested the following web sites. Of
   course, some may have a "nominal" fee, some have one free
   search.<BR>
   Scholarships for Women and Minorities: <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/ox13qr/webpages/eyfswm1.html">http://members.aol.com/ox13qr/webpages/eyfswm1.html</A>
   Yahoo! Scholarship Programs: <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Education/Financial_Aid/Scholarship_Programs/">http://www.yahoo.com/Education/Financial_Aid/Scholarship_Programs/</A>
   <A HREF="http://www2.nas.edu/cpc/index.html">http://www2.nas.edu/cpc/index.html</A><BR>
   <A HREF="http://www.hr.lanl.gov/html/specprog/bulletinboard/">http://www.hr.lanl.gov/html/specprog/bulletinboard/</A>
   (there are 2 scholarship programs on the LANL student bulletin
   board)<BR>
   I'm sure there a lots more. One sure bet is to contact Veterinary
   Colleges (or the appropriate department for other interests), and
   get a list from them.</LI>
   
   <LI>For people already in school, it was suggested that the
   financial aid office of the university would probably be the best
   place to start.</LI>
   
   <LI>Student loans are somewhat easier to obtain than scholarships,
   and might be worth considering as an alternative for people who

<HR> <H3><A NAME=req></A>REQUEST FOR ACTION: JANUARY LOBBY FOR WICHE
ACCESS CHANGE</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Date: Mon, 8 Dec 1997 From: "Christopher J. Fontes"
   &lt;cjf@xdiv.lanl.gov&gt;
   
   <P>It's been a couple of months since I first contacted you about
   the WICHE (Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education)
   student exchange program situation. We know enough now about the
   situation that Julie and I are lobbying the state legislature for
   the upcoming session in January. The folks from the WICHE office
   are also lobbying for a change too. So now I'm asking you to send
   out a call to all interested parties who are interested in joining
   the lobby effort.
   
   <P>We all feel that the requirement of having a NM high school
   diploma to be eligible for the WICHE program is too restrictive
   and unfairly excludes residents/tax payers who might otherwise be
   qualified for the program. This requirement will undermine the
   quality of the program in the future. We have been told by WICHE
   personnel that the provision of requiring a NM high school diploma
   was a knee-jerk response to allegations that people are moving to
   NM from out-of state in order to take advantage of the WICHE
   program. We have been able to find no documents that support this
   allegation. In addition the same legislation officially change
   WICHE from a grant program to a fee-for-service program, which
   requires enrollees to work exclusively in NM for so many years
   after receipt of degree.
   
   <P>We are lobbying the legislature to eliminate the requirement of
   a NM high school diploma. The WICHE folks think the legislature
   will do this provided they instead require NM residency for a
   certain number of years (anywhere from 3-5 years is what we have
   heard). We feel that a requirement of state residency will allow
   for the consideration of those residents who have moved to NM
   after receiving a high school diploma from a different state.
   
   <P>I am not wild about the fee-for-service stipulations listed
   above (there are indications that this option will allow for the
   exploitation of newly minted graduates in certain fields). But it
   appears that the legislature is under pressure to get something in
   return for their offering of educational support. Additionally,
   the fee-for-service option should discourage people from wanting
   to move to NM, assuming that is what's really happening, just to
   get into the WICHE program and then go on their merry way after
   receiving their education.
   
   <P>If you could send this missive to the WIS distribution and ask
   for interested parties, it would be much appreciated. Below is a
   letter that Julie has sent to Governor Johnson and various state
   reps and senators. From the letter you can see that the
   legislation which enacted the requirement of a NM high school
   diploma was an amendment to Senate Bill 1115. The addresses of the
   governor and the representative/senator for Los Alamos are also
   given:

<P>--- (letter from Julie to Governor Johnson follows) ---

<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Governor Johnson:
   
   <P>I am writing to tell you how a recent amendment of the WICHE
   (Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education) student
   exchange program, requiring participants to have a NM high school
   diploma, has affected my life. And I am asking you to change the
   law in the upcoming legislative session.
   
   <P>I am a twenty-nine year old physical therapist who moved to NM
   in 1995. My one dream in life has been to become a veterinarian.
   Having finally reached a point in life where I could follow that
   dream, I began making inquiries in early 1997. I contacted several
   schools and veterinarians and they suggested I look into the WICHE
   program (then run by UNM). In case you are not familiar with this
   program, it allows certified students to attend certain
   out-of-state schools, which have programs not offered by any NM
   school, for in-state tuition.
   
   <P>The NM WICHE employee I spoke with in March of 1997 indicated
   that since I had resided in the state for two years and held a
   current driver's license, car registration and bank account I
   would be able to participate in the program. He stated that I
   needed to wait for applications to be printed, and suggested I
   call back in early May to request my application.
   
   <P>I was overjoyed. I was confident I would be accepted into vet
   school, having an excellent academic background (a 4.0 GPA
   Master's degree in Physical Therapy and a 3.75 GPA Bachelor's
   degree in Biology). I reduced my working hours as a therapist and
   began volunteering at The Wildlife Center in Espanola with
   Kathleen Ramsay, DVM, to get the veterinary experience I needed
   for my vet school application.
   
   <P>I called the NM WICHE program again in May, and was told they
   were in transition. Worried that the program was changing, I spoke
   again with several employees and they assured me that all was well
   and that they were just restructuring and relocating to Santa Fe.
   I was told to call back in July for my application.
   
   <P>Reassured, I made plans to leave my job and began full-time
   preveterinary work at The Wildlife Center. When I called WICHE
   back in July and was told applications were not yet ready, I was
   not too nervous. I again questioned the employee with whom I spoke
   and was told that funding was solid and that "vet-med" students
   were a priority.
   
   <P>Not until I called back in August did I learn of my dismal
   prospects. I spoke with Lillian Montoya-Real and was told for the
   first time that an amendment to Senate Bill #1115C had changed the
   program and that now a NM high school diploma was a requirement
   for participation. Essentially, I was told that there was no way I
   could be funded as an in-state student at any university. This
   forces me to leave the state to be able to afford vet school--just
   because I do not possess a NM high school diploma (and despite the
   fact that I am a tax-paying resident who is in every other way
   extremely qualified). What angers me so much is that I have lost a
   year. I now have to move and establish residency in a state with a
   vet school and reapply (and pay for that new application) for
   1999. If I had been told earlier of the amendment, I could have
   established residency in another state and entered school in 1998.
   By not informing me of the changes in rules until late August the
   people of the NM WICHE program did me a great disservice. I think
   what upsets me most, though, is that I am being forced out of the
   state--out of my home--if I want to follow my dream.
   
   <P>The people I have spoken with at WICHE since July have been
   much more helpful. Lillian and Ken have been very honest and
   encouraging. They have both informed me that they disagree with
   the "diploma amendment" and feel that since this is now a
   "loan-for-four years of service" that the clause is redundant.
   They have assured me that they will lobby the state legislature to
   eliminate the amendment, and I promised to do my part by informing
   you of how this has affected me.
   
   <P>I ask you again to please change the law. I agree
   wholeheartedly with the four years of service as partial repayment
   of New Mexico's generosity. I would gladly serve longer--and hope
   to spend the rest of my life and career here. I also agree that
   the program should only be open to residents who show that they
   are "here to stay". But to require a NM high school diploma
   excludes many qualified residents who should be allowed to compete
   to participate in this program. To exclude us is unfair and will
   not allow some of the most qualified people to receive funding and
   become NM veterinarians. This will hurt NM in the long run--by
   diminishing the quality of services provided. Please do not allow
   this to happen. It is within your power to make things right.
   Thank you for your time and consideration.
