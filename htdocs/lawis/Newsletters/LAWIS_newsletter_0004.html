<!-- Steering committee minutes -->

<h3><a name=min></a>STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING MINUTES</h3>
<p>The last Steering Committee meeting took place on March 9th, 2000.   
The minutes that follow haven't yet been officially approved, but I
think they capture what we discussed pretty completely.  The final approved 
version will be posted on the Web after the Steering Committee meets on April 
13th.</p>
<p> 
<b>BIG NEWS: WE HAVE A POST OFFICE BOX. </b> You'll see in the minutes below that 
Alexine strongly urged we spend the money on a P.O. Box.  Janie took care of 
the problem immediately. Our new, official address as of March 13th:
<br>
<br>

<p align=center><b><font color=navy>
Los Alamos Women in Science (LAWIS)<br>
P.O. Box 564<br>
Los Alamos, NM  87544</font></b></p>
<br>


<p>
<b>Members Present:</b> Janie Enter, Mary Stinecipher-Campbell, Alexine Salazar,
 Susana Delgado, Huyen Dinh, Margo Clark, Cathy Cleland, Laura McNamara.  
Tinka Gammel arrived at 8AM.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Minutes: </b>The meeting began with unanimous approval of the January and February meeting minutes.  Members suggested minor
corrections to the February minutes, including a couple of spelling changes in names.  Cathy Cleland also noted that she was listed as a
presenter in the EYH information included in the February Minutes; she clarified that she was an organizer, not a presenter and that she
doesn't care to be listed - but wants to make sure that the presenters get credit for their work.  Alexine noted that the EYH info in the
February minutes and said that an updated version of this year's EYH information on the Web would list Cathy correctly as an organizer.
With these corrections, the minutes were approved.
</p>

<p>
<b>Treasurer's Report:</b> Susana Delano gave the Treasurer's Report. She said 
that the LAWIS books hade been audited by Angelique and Claudia, and that she
 was waiting for their signatures to finalize the audit.  The only minor problem
 uncovered was a check that was listed in the deposit rather than the debit 
column.  Susana also said that she has gotten her name and signature on the 
card at the bank and can now write checks.  She has reimbursed Cathy $51 (and 
still owes her a whopping 21 cents), and reimbursed herself for $125. Checks 
totaling $675.00 were deposited to the EYH account. She is going to deposit 
the checks for EYH.  Margo and Alexine will be owed money for EYH activities 
and as Susana gets receipts she will reimburse them for EYH related expenses.  
Susana will be leaving soon for extended travel, though the dates aren't
definite.  She will hand the checkbooks over to Janie when her travel dates are
 finalized and she is ready to leave. The LAWIS accounts are still in
the black.
</p>

<p>
<b>Membership Report: </b>Cathy Cleland gave the membership report. Cathy Cleland
 has done a lot of work with the membership database, updating it with 
information she's gotten from the state office and transferring the entire 
database from FileMaker Pro to Excel.  She entered the new people and updated 
much of the information in the database, including information about 
education and work backgrounds, 
which she says are 'impressive.'  Cathy also asked the Committee about the
Member-at-large position - is anyone filling it currently?  There was no 
agreement about who is currently considered our member-at-large, though it is 
agreed that she cannot be holding one of the executive positions.  However,
 committee chairs are eligible for member-at-large status. Lastly, Cathy will 
be e-mailing members who haven't paid their latest dues to remind them that they
 need to send a check in to maintain their membership.  She asks that anyone 
who receives this e-mail respond ASAP to let her know if they've already 
updated their account, since there's a delay between the time when members 
send in their dues, and the time at which the state organization forwards the 
information to her.</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Lunchtime Talks:</b> Huyen reported that she has talks scheduled through May
 now.  The next Lunchtime talk is on 14 March, when Claudia Lewis will speak on 
"Using Quaternary dating methods, stratigraphy and patterns of stream incision 
to constrain models of post-orogenic rock uplift: Preliminary results from the 
Ebro basin, Spain."  Lisa Gutierrez from the Laboratory's Diversity Office has 
agreed to speak in May, but wants some guidance about an appropriate topic. 
Huyen e-mailed the LAWIS list for approval of several different discussion 
topics.  Janie mentioned that Cas Mason in trying to coordinate something with 
AAUW that's of mutual interest; perhaps Lisa's talk could be that event? Huyen 
will talk to Cas about that.  Meanwhile, the Steering Committee discussed 
several topics for conversation, including a discussion of the role of women's 
organizations at the Laboratory, the retention and recruitment of female staff, particularly postdocs; how the DVO is defining
its mission and what its role/agenda will be in the future, particularly now 
that it's split from OEO.   Huyen said that Lisa has some stats on women at 
LANL and may be able to give a good discussion about gender and culture 
communications.  Also discussed: bringing other speakers to the Laboratory, 
including Madeline Albright. Janie suggested that Huyen call her office; Janie 
found her staffers helpful and noted that the Sate Department would probably 
pick up the tab for her visit, since there's some talk about a transparency/
disarmament center being developed at the Laboratory.  LAWIS may explore 
bringing women who wrote "Their Day in the Sun."  Get together with Museum or 
Director's Office to co-sponsor their visit, perhaps organize a colloquium on 
the book.
</p>

<p>
<b>Expanding Your Horizons:</b> 
Alexine, Janie and everyone else involved in EYH Coordination is tired this week, but their hard work paid
off enormously with another successful day of talks and workshops.  147 girls of the 168 registered attended the event, 23 schools were
represented. EYH this year had 18 workshops, up from 16 last year.  28 presenters, 18 'gophers' helped out. Everything was 'more' this year, said
Alexine - kids, workshops, teachers, schools, workshops and PAPERWORK, which was a headache and has the potential to get worse. 
Committee this year had to deal with a lot of issues related to security and safety.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line: getting EYH off the ground will get harder and harder. Transportation is becoming a major problem, since we are no longer
allowed to use GSA vans/taxis to transport minors who are not in the employ of the Laboratory.  Personal vehicles are one option, but the driver
must assume personal liability.  Alexine said that the state organization might have to assume some sort of insurance responsibility for EYH
participants here, since our site has unique transportation issues (as in, we can't do EYH without some sort of transportation system for
participants).  Susana suggested renting vans, but question of how to pay, allowable expenses, comes up with rentals. Other paperwork problems:
in future, there will be more permission/release forms required, including parental permission for girls to participate, for photos to be taken of
the participants, for transportation, and possibly other legal issues.  
</p>
<p>Security is also a huge stickler: the focus on security has impacted everything at the Laboratory and EYH is no exception.  One major security
problem this year concerned 2 girls who are not citizens of the United States - Laboratory was going to require that they be badged.  Backed off
because girls are only in 8th grade, but Janie both question where it's written that any visitor over the 8th grade has to be badged at all.  Alexine
pointed out that Laboratory management and DOE both insist that they are not trying to discriminate against foreign nationals, but the badging
issue directly marks these kids as outsiders, not just to Laboratory but also to classmates.   Could have negative impacts on the girls, particularly
if they're immigrants whose parents are trying to establish citizenship.  Suggestion that Diversity Office take up this issue. General agreement
among Steering Committee seemed to be that this is a very important problem, one that could hurt some of the girls by identifying them as
'outsiders.' EYH organizers will have to address this issue next year; as Alexine pointed out, our program is unique and how we establish our
policies can set precedents for other programs and for the Laboratory.
</p>
<p>Alexine also talked about funding from within the Laboratory, that technical divisions give what little money they can, but generally don't have
much fiscal wiggle room for things like EYH, and frequently ask why STB isn't underwriting the EYH program.  STB does provide support for
substitute teachers in schools. Substitutes are a more easily allowable cost for STB than EYH because of their existing programs with schools for
teachers. EYH spent some of its money to give teachers book about encouraging girls to go into math and science (if you're interested in ordering
a copy, the ISBN is 0-86651-323-X and Alexine can get info for you), as well as lunch for the teachers that attended.  These are allowable
costs.   Lots of discussion about different groups in Laboratory that offer funding - STB, DVO, CRO, technical divisions, etc. Internal funding
will probably continue to be a problem for organizers next year.
</p>
<p>EYH accounts probably nearly zero-ed out, Alexine reported, but she asked Committee to approve fiscal support for an EYH thank-you
party/closeout meeting on the 16th of March.  Motion was made, seconded, and approved for roughly 500 in support for refreshments for 70 or so
people, maybe fruit and dessert?
</p>
<h4>EYH Odds and Ends:</h4>
<ul type=disc>
   <li>Alexine reminded the Steering Committee that it needs to get a new EYH Chair for next year.
   <li>Margo asked a question about the registration deadline and it was noted that Laboratory staff members can enroll their children directly
through the Laboratory; they don't have to go through their schools.  They do face the same deadlines that schools do.  However, as long as there's
space, EYH will happily accept registration from daughters of Lab employees independent of their school's decision to participate.
   <li>Presenters got 'Thank You' pins (magnets) from Ortiz.
   <li>Planning Committee Members will be asking for reimbursement from the EYH account for some of her expenses.
   <li>Alexine suggested strongly that LAWIS get a P.O. Box.  Janie will look into pricing and availability.
   <li>Foodservice from Aramark this year was uneven. 
   <li>Monitor, Newsbulletin both covered the event but where were other local newspapers?
   <li>Laura volunteered to bring Career booklets from Los Alamos to Albuquerque for upcoming EYH event there. She will bring the to Kelly
Bittner in ABQ for their packets.
</ul>
<br>

<p><b>SCIENCE FAIR UPDATES: </b>Margo reported that the State science fair is coming up soon in Socorro but didn't know the exact date.  Cathy was
LAWIS representative for regional fair at NM Highlands, said that since LAWIS gave $50 for awards we are now considered a '<font color=gray><b>Silver Donor</b></font>.' 
Also sent over stickers, the ever-popular dinosaur certificates for kids, and sent a self-addressed, stamped envelope so we can find out who won
our awards. Highlands is interested in getting LAWIS to judge but Cathy told them that we were 'judged out.' They suggested that we conserve
our energies next year to judge at regionals, since it's a pretty big event - 400 kids. Also, the Taos Science Fair organizers called Tinka and
winners' names are now on the Webpage.
</p>

<p><b>BYLAWS: </b>Mary has identified one potentially problematic area in the bylaws: can we do e-mail elections?  E-mail not secure or private. Tinka
will look into ways of solving problem, including establishing a one-time-only voting mechanism for the Web Page using a unique identifier for
each member. She is also going to amend the by-laws so that the 'one year in good standing' provision for membership in the Steering
Committee is changed to read 'in good standing,' since Steering Committee isn't really paying attention to that rule anyway.  Please see
discussion below under 'Webpage' for more about the vote-by-web issue.
</p>

<p>
<b>NEWSLETTER:</b> Laura will ask Huyen for names of LAWIS members who need to get hardcopy of newsletter.  Also will finish a LAWIS
introductory brochure for inclusion in New Hire packets.  Has to be in at HR by May 1 for summer students.
</p>

<p><b>WEBPAGE:  </b>Tinka reported that we got an apology from Inkspot for spamming LAWIS members, but Tinka is worried about members dropping
off list every time something like this happens.  Steering Committee members discussed options for restricting list activity so spamming
opportunities are limited. Tinka has talked to CIC representative who expects that Laboratory will soon have access to software that limits
posting ability to people on a list AND within a certain general domain - like 'LANL.GOV.'  Janie suggested restricting posting ability to
LAWIS subscribers only, but Tinka pointed out that we do get legitimate postings from Lab organizations; she prefers that they be able to post
directly, so that her name/LAWIS is not connected to activities or events (as it would be if she were to forward info to list).
</p>

<p><b>ODDS AND ENDS AT THE END: </b>Also discussion of encouraging/inviting representatives from other LANL women's organizations, like the
WDWG, to our meetings.  This might be a way of recruiting new members for the Steering Committee next year.  Perhaps ask someone from
SEAC to attend meetings, get involved in activities.
The meeting was adjourned at 8:45 AM.

<p><b>TINKA IS PLANNING, PLANNING, PLANNING: </b> Cathy Sisneros of the Santa Fe Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Public Information
Office is wondering if LAWIS members are interested in hearing an update on WIPP.  Tinka Gammel is collecting responses from LAWIS
members, so you can contact her to cast your vote. If you're interested in having Cathy talk to your group, you can call her directly at 982-7129. 
Tinka has also been thinking about field trips lately....  Her list of possible destinations includes a combined WIPP/Carlsbad/Trinity Site venture,
similar to the one that she organized a couple of years ago. trip to White Sands or other interesting area, a trip to the Nevada Test Site, a visit to
Chaco Canyon near Farmington to look at the 25'' telescope recently donated to the site, and a local Jemez geology field trip.  You can call Tinka
to discuss these possibilities with her, or e-mail her: <a href="mailto:jtg@lanl.gov">jtg@lanl.gov</a>.

<b>Lunchtime Talk, Wednesday, April 12, 2000, 11:30 am -1:00 pm,</b> Otowi Cafeteria, Sideroom C:  Irene J. Beyerlein, MST-8: STRUCTURE
PROPERTY RELATIONS, will be giving a talk entitled 'Micromechanical Stress Redistribution Models And Their Implications On Statistical
Failure Of Composites.' ABSTRACT: In this talk, I will present results from various shear lag models for stress redistributions from multiple
fiber breaks in large, unidirectional continuous fiber composites. Agreement is quantified for simple configurations of fiber breaks. The
implications of these stress concentration results on statistical crack formation are discussed. Closed form expressions for key fiber stress
concentrations are applied in developing probabilistic strength theories. The analytical probability models predictions are shown to be in good
agreement with empirical distributions from representative Monte Carlo simulations of elastic composite fracture.

<b>Careers and Curiosity is Coming up Quickly!</b>  Put this on your calendar: April 11th, 2000, for the first time being held at Espanola Middle
School. The AAUW sponsors this activity to acquaint young girls with the possibility of careers involving math and science, to encourage them
to take math and science courses in middle and high school, and to acquaint young boys with women who have successful careers in these areas.
The teachers have specifically requested presentations in the areas of geology (rock samples), water quality, genetics including anything to do
with DNA, ecology and anything to do with chemistry. This list should not be used to exclude other areas.  You can get involved: women who use
math and science in their careers are being invited to set up hands-on activities at local schools for a day. Participation in Careers and Curiosity is
approved by the Laboratory for Community Service Time, by submitting a form 704 available online at <a href="http://enterprise.lanl.gov/forms/704.pdf">enterprise.lanl.gov/forms/704.pdf</a>.
These kids really need to see what career opportunities are out there. Denise says: 'As an added incentive, the principal has offered to feed us
lunch. I have sampled her cooking and it's worth a trip to Espanola!' For more information about Careers and Curiosity and some great photos of
previous events check out <a href="http://home.lanl.gov/dcg/CC/C+C.html">home.lanl.gov/dcg/CC/C+C.html</a>.   You can also contact Denise George: 667-6248, or
