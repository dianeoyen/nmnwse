ELECTION RESULTS: NEW FACES, OLD PLACES
---------------------------------------

Thank you to all the members for promptly returning your ballots for this
fall's election of the LAWIS board. We sometimes have trouble getting
enough ballots back, especially when the candidates run unopposed. We held
our first board meeting at Wendee Brunish's house on October 15th.  Both
old members and new members were in attendance. At this meeting, the
following board positions were assigned to the new 1996-97 LAWIS board
members. The * indicates a new board member.
 
President - Karen Schultz Paige (through 2/97 only), ksp@lanl.gov
Vice President - Margo Clark *, jmclark@lanl.gov
Secretary - Ginger Young, ginger@kc.trail.com 
Treasurer - Trish Wright, pwright@lanl.gov 
Newsletter Editor - Tinka Gammel *, jtg@lanl.gov
EYH Chair - Joyce Guzik, joy@lanl.gov
Membership - Carol LaDelfe*, cladelfe@lanl.gov
Members-at-large - Diane Albert, dalbert@lanl.gov

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
-------------------

Autumn has arrived and with it, a brand new crop of LAWIS Board members.
The new board members are Tinka Gammel, Amy Andersen, Margo Clark, and
Carol LaDelfe. Libby Jones has graciously accepted another two year
position on the board. I would like to thank the outgoing members for all
their contributions in the last two years: Wendee Brunish, Deborah Kubicek,
Bonnie Yantis, and Shirley Herrera. I am hopeful that these dynamic women
will continue their active association with LA Women in Science.

Autumn has also brought with it a flurry of activities associated with the
end of our LAWIS calendar: our local annual meeting and the state NMNWSE
annual meeting, held in Santa Fe this year. Both meetings were quite
enjoyable. The state NMNWSE annual meeting had a large number of presenters
from LANL due to the proximity to Santa Fe. It was great to meet local
people as well as members of other chapters. I hope that many of our
members will attend next year's state annual meeting because it is a great
way to meet interesting women in science.

Now that LAWIS is starting a new year, I hope that you will get involved
with the luncheons, socials, and outreach activities we have planned. LAWIS
provides an opportunity to reconnect with women you haven't seen recently
and meet new members and younger women starting their technical careers.
 
Sincerely, 
Karen Schultz Paige 
President

NEWS FROM THE MEMBERSHIP CHAIR
------------------------------

Our NMNWSE and LAWIS Membership Year is defined as from October 1 to
September 30.  Wyona Turner, Membership Chair of NMNWSE, sent out renewal
notices to be returned in September, but new members may not have received
one or may not have realized that the membership dues for LAWIS are
collected by NMNWSE.  Our chapter dues are rebated from the State
organization, so no separate dues are collected from LAWIS members.  If you
have not sent in your renewal to NMNWSE (or paid it at the Annual Meeting
in Santa Fe), please send it as soon  as you can.  If you have lost (or
didn't receive) your membership form, there is a copy available from the
web page (in Adobe Acrobat format) at 
http://ladmac.lanl.gov/nmnwse/  
in the "Membership in NMNWSE" section or, if you are unable to access that
one, send me a message and I can put one in the mail for you.  (If you are
not planning to renew your membership at this time, please let us know why,
if possible.)

LAWIS HOME PAGE; ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTER
--------------------------------------

LAWIS has a home page for anything people want to post:
http://www.lanl.gov:8010/subject/wis 
Deborah Kubicek has previously been maintaining it, putting board
meeting minutes, EYH minutes, and the LAWIS bylaws on it, as well as a
link to the NMNWSE home page. We need someone to take over this, and
put it on their own web server (Nb: it has LANL approval from the old
Club 1663 days). Any Volunteers?

Also, is there any interest in getting the newsletter electronically,
either through the LAWIS home page, or through a listserver site, or
just a list of email addresses kept by the Newsletter Editor (=me)?
I have made preliminary inquiries into getting a LANL listserver
alias. It does seem to be possible, but I have not pursued it to the 
end. For now, if you prefer to get a copy electronically
please send me an email, jtg@lanl.gov, and I'll add you to my
local LAWIS alias for the next Newsletter, or any intermediate updates.

1997 EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS PROGRAM: EYH REQUEST FOR VOLUNTEERS
----------------------------------------------------------------

LAWIS will once again sponsor the Expanding Your Horizons Program for
8th-10th grade girls.  Last year we had about 100 girls from throughout
northern New Mexico come to the lab to hear speakers and participate in
hands-on workshops with women scientists/engineers so that they could
experience first-hand what it would be like to have a career in science or
engineering.

Our next EYH program will be held Wednesday, March 19, 1997.  We welcome
your help as a workshop presenter or speaker, help on the organizing
committee (recruiting, publicity, fund-raising, transportation, etc.) and
on the day of the conference, and your suggestions for speakers,
activities, and workshop leaders.  Please call Joyce Guzik (667-8927) or
send E-mail to joy@lanl.gov, if you would like to volunteer to help with
EYH (no experience necessary!)  We will have bi-weekly lunchtime meetings
starting in December to brainstorm and coordinate preparations.

ALEXIS TOUR FOR LAWIS MEMBERS OFFERED BY SANDRA FLETCHER
--------------------------------------------------------

LAWIS member Sandra Fletcher has offered to give us an inside tour of the
ALEXIS X-ray satellite control room as ALEXIS passes overhead.  The ALEXIS
project demonstrated that small satellites could be launched, built, and
operated very inexpensively, and return worthwhile state-of-the-art
scientific results.  Sandy has an exciting video showing the launch of
ALEXIS from a Pegasus rocket on the wing of a B-52, April 25, 1991.  The
video shows how one of ALEXIS' solar panels became damaged during launch,
causing it to spin out of control.  Contact with the satellite was lost
until June 2 when the satellite moved into position for the Sun to
illuminate its solar panels and recharge its batteries.  The ALEXIS team
was able to figure out the motion of the satellite and where it's X-ray
telescope is pointed, and thereby compensate for the complex motion in
their image analysis.  ALEXIS has been able to complete all of its
scientific objectives, and has outlived its expected lifetime.  Sandy will
also tell us about the scientific goals of ALEXIS, including understanding
outbursts from cataclysmic binary stars, and the nature of mysterious
gamma-ray bursts.

Please "sign up" for tours by sending E-mail to Sandy at sfletche@nis.lanl.gov,
or call her at 667-0509.  Sandy can accommodate about 10 people per tour.
The tour will take approximately an hour, including video.

Meet in the Moon Room (Physics building, TA-3, SM-40, room N-125, near
NIS-2 group office)

Potential tour times are:
 * Friday, November 22     10:20 am (ALEXIS passes over at 10:38 am)
 * Monday, November 25     10:30 am (ALEXIS passes over at 10:48 am)
 * Tuesday, November 26    10:00 am (ALEXIS passes over at 10:18 am)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REGULAR LAWIS LUNCHES?
----------------------

In order to increase member participation in LAWIS, and simply to help
us get to know one another, I propose that LAWIS start a series of
regularly scheduled lunches.

To increase the odds that it will actually get off the ground, I'd like
this to be as informal as possible:  no scheduled speakers, no advance
reservations, conveniently located for a large number of members,
guests and random drop-ins welcome, etc:  just a regular chance to meet
and eat! [Everybody has to take time to eat anyway,  -- at least once 
in a while -- right?]

If people feel that they would like a bit more of an agenda, I can see
about trying to line up a few people willing to talk 15-30 minutes
about their research or other topics they'd like to share.

What do people think of trying to get, eg, one of the side room
cafeterias at the lab reserved on a monthly basis? 

Or should we be even more informal and just say, eg, "LAWIS members
will tend to eat at 12:30 on Mondays in the LANL main cafeteria towards
the south wall" (just an example -- but I'm usually there then anyhow,
and will try and remember to eat there then Mondays through the end of the
year if you want to give me your opinion in person ...)

If you would be interested in attending, please let me know: 
 * the location you'd prefer 
 * the frequency you'd like to meet (weekly, biweekly, monthly) 
 * the day of the week you'd prefer (or staggered) 
 * the time of the day you'd prefer (doesn't have to be lunch; 
   if lunch, specify 11:30 or 12:30 to avoid the 12:00 crowd)

NEWS FROM THE NMNWSE MEETING:
FORTH-FIVE ENJOY ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN SANTE FE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Northern Chapter of New Mexico Network of Women in Science and
Engineering put on a highly successful Technical Symposium and Annual
Meeting at the Ft. Marcy Compound in Santa Fe October 18, and 19. This
year's conference was dedicated to long-time, enthusiastic NMNWSE supporter
Georgia Fritz, who died in a hiking accident this summer. Forty women
registered before the conference, and five more registered after the
conference started. Two participants attended on scholarships.

Winding up fine technical presentations on Friday afternoon, the first
invited speaker, Charisse Sydoriak, Bandelier National Monument Resources
Manager, gave us the first-ever public briefing on the consequences of the
Dome Fire to cultural resources in the Monument. Sydoriak showed color
slides; some gave heartbreaking glimpses of beautiful areas turned into a
desert of stumps and ash. Other slides were shocking as they showed just
how close the fire crept to the well-known caves close to the Monument
Headquarters.

On Saturday, amid more excellent presentations and following the Annual
Meeting, Keynote Speaker State Senator Liz Stefanics gave us her "take" on
women in politics (makes the guys clean up their act!) and urged us and our
women friends to become active in the political process. As she talked, we
enjoyed the first of our delicious catered meals.

Following the afternoon session, participants and guests were treated to a
fine dinner and the final invited speaker, Pearl Sunrise, a Navajo
storyteller. Sunrise likened the different phases of her life to the houses
she lived in, from her girlhood in a traditional hogan, to her room at
boarding school, to her lecture halls at UNM, to her home in Albuquerque,
where she and her husband raised their children. She also sang and answered
questions from her audience. Watch for Sunrise as she tours around the
state with "Knaa Kahidi Theater," an Alaskan/Native New Mexican group,
sometime in the next four months.

The following people gave technical presentations: Diane Albert,
"Supervising a Metallography and Microscopy Laboratory at Los Alamos
National Laboratory: Challenges and Rewards"; Kelly Bitner, "Application of
Data Quality Objectives to Los Alamos National Laboratory Groundwater
Protection"; Wendee Brunish, "Monitoring a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty"; Kieran
Cloud, "Protein Transport into the Nucleus"; Kay P. Coddens, "Women Helping
Women"; Sandra J. Fletcher, Small Satellite Operations as Experienced by
the ALEXIS Team"; Dawn Hipsh, "Proposal Mining and Marketing on the World
Wide Web"; Roberta Day Idzorek, "Nuclear Weapons: Past, Present, and
Future"; Yolanda Jones King, "Congressional Experiences from My LEGIS
Fellowship"; Lauren McCain, "Addressing Social Implications of Genetic
Science and Technology: Women Take On the Challenge"; Amy E. McNeil,
"Searching for EUV Counterparts to Gamma Ray Bursts with ALEXIS"; Angelique
Neuman, "Fabrication and Properties of Erbium Oxide"; Jennifer L. W.
Siders, "The Physics GRE and the Consequences of its Misuse"; Mary Ann
Sweeney, "How to Manage without Being a Manager"; and Xin Miao Zhao,
Lightning Control and Diversion with High Peak Power Laser Beams."

The volunteer committee for the 1996 NMNWSE Annual Meeting included Wendee
Brunish, Dede Collins, Deborah Kubicek (chair), Ann Mauzy, Alexine Salazar,
Nancy Scheer, Nina Thayer, Lynda Towers, and Ginger Young.

REMEMBERING GEORGIA FRITZ
-------------------------

(Text of the Georgia Fritz memorial at the last LAWIS luncheon, 
by Elizabeth Aiello)

It is indeed fitting that we take time today to remember Georgia Fritz.  I
strongly suspect that this is the first Annual Meeting of the Los Alamos
Women in Science that has convened without Georgia Fritz being present. Had
not fate and chance intervened, Georgia would indeed be here today.  She
would stride breathlessly through the door, excited and eager to share with
us her adventures in Greece and Spain, the Smithsonian tour, booked in
early spring, from which she would have recently returned.

      But fate and chance did intervene. 
       
      Not in the hills of Athens
      Nor in the deep Aegean Sea 
      
      Not in the Gardens of Granada
      Nor in the snow-covered Pyrenees 
      
      But in the open palm of New Mexico's mountains
      Where Majestic crags loom
      And sacred waters flow
      Fate and chance laid Georgia down to sleep forever. 
       

Georgia's chair at board meetings, conferences, and social functions is now
empty, but that empty chair is an honored place.  More than one person will
be needed to occupy it.  The myriad tasks that had to be done, tasks that
nobody else but Georgia would do, must now be undertaken by others.  Oh,
yes, the tasks will be done; but, to quote Rosemarie Fredrickson, "We will
miss Georgia's boundless enthusiasm and energy."

To me, Georgia was perpetual motion.  She was always coming from some
activity, and rushing on her way to another activity--frequently
breathless, often feigning exhaustion that never seemed to materialize,
forever totally exhilarated by the projects she had undertaken.  Those
projects became the foundation of Georgia's legacy for us, a legacy that
boggles our minds and defies emulation.  Georgia created this legacy
through her unique devotion to three causes:  Recognition for the
significant contributions to science made by women, expansion of
opportunities for careers in science for women, and support for the
educational and equity programs sponsored by the American Association of
University Women.

In collaboration with Sandra Zink and an elite group of women scientists,
Judy Gursky, Patsy Rivera, Lucy Carruthers, and Gloria Cordova among
others, Georgia contributed organizational expertise, enthusiasm and
tenacity to create a much-needed professional group for women and the Los
Alamos National Laboratory.  Tenacity was a hallmark for Georgia.  At times
it could drive one crazy, but often it was Georgia's tenacity that got a
much-needed job done, and done thoroughly.

The active presence of the Los Alamos Women in Science fostered a new
awareness of the caliber and productivity of women scientists at the
laboratory.  But the organization needed a project, a focus.  It found that
focus in Reentry Women.  Within a year, the group had a commitment from the
Los Alamos branch of the University of New Mexico to support a science
degree-granting program for reentry women as well as a commitment from the
Los Alamos National Laboratory to supplement the education program with a
paid internship program.  Georgia was in the foreground of the preparation
that went into securing those commitments.  With characteristic
thoroughness and dedication to pin-point accuracy (that tenacity factor
again), Georgia researched the rules and regulations mandated to govern the
program.  She guided the group through the legal maze that an innovative
program involving a university and a federally-funded laboratory would
trail-blaze and then wrote the by-laws under which the reentry program
would operate.  Having logical, workable and productive rules, and abiding
by those rules, was another hallmark for Georgia.

When the University and the Laboratory had honored their commitments, and
the reentry program was in place, Georgia remained a significant
contributor to the program's decade of nationally-acclaimed successes.  She
served a s a member of the committee that interviewed and selected the
participants in the pioneer class and in each subsequent class.  Georgia
remained an influential member of the reentry program's advisory committee
throughout the life of the program.  She volunteered tutor and mentor help
for reentry students having difficulty with chemistry and other academic
subjects.  She was the instructor for a variety of segments in the
professional development course that was the keystone of the reentry
program.  125 graduate of the program, ten of whom now have earned their
ten-year service pins from the Laboratory, are living testimony to
Georgia's success in helping the advancement of science education and
well-paid job opportunities for women.

The reentry program was not, however, the only "women in science" project
that captured Georgia's interest and profited from her talents.  She helped
bring about the affiliation of the Los Alamos Women in Science with the New
Mexico Women in Science, and served on the advisory board of the state
organization several times.  Needless to say, she continuously served as
by-laws chairperson for both groups for over a decade.  Georgia helped
pioneer the "Expanding Your Horizons" programs sponsored by the Los Alamos
Women in Science and supported by the Laboratory to acquaint high-school
girls with the opportunities for careers in science.  During the decade,
the "Expanding Your Horizons" program has been in place, Georgia played an
infinite number of roles:  Coordinator, workshop presenter, facilities
manager, treasurer, awards chairperson, speaker, recruiter... Where there
was a need, Georgia was there to meet it, usually carrying out multiple
tasks and tenaciously bringing each task to a productive end.

The Los Alamos schools science fair committee found in Georgia a valuable
resource in recruiting judges and establishing guidelines for awarding
prizes.  Georgia was equally active in her commitment to the American
Association of University Women at all three levels of organization:
Local, State, and National.  She served continuously as by-laws chairperson
at the local and state levels beginning in the 1970's and quickly became
respected state-wide as "the by-laws expert".  She was a productive member
of local, state, and national AAUW advisory boards, and a principal
participant at state and national conventions.  At least once during every
advisory board session, someone had valid reason to say, "Ask Georgia.
She'll know!"  or "I bet Georgia would be willing to handle that."  And she
did know, and she was willing to handle that, whatever that was!

About six years ago, Georgia created the Cultural Affairs Study Group for
Los Alamos AAUW members.  She graciously and efficiently coordinated
dining, musical, theatrical, educational, and historical events for members
to attend.  She will be prominent in our thoughts this weekend when the
group attends two concerts for which Georgia made plans and purchased our
tickets last spring.  I'll miss that last-minute phone call from Georgia
telling me breathlessly that she will be "5 or 10 minutes late" because she
had just come in from a hike or an emergency trip to Albuquerque and hasn't
showered yet!

Unfortunately, in all of the roles Georgia played, there was no understudy.
Recasting those roles is proving extremely difficult.  Keep in mind that
Georgia was involved in all of this activity simultaneously, not
sequentially.  Still, she found time to write and present significant
papers at annual meetings of the America Chemical Society, the American
Association for Testing Metals, and the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, and even time to serve on the governing committees
of these organizations.

Georgia also found time for her family.  She was the unifying force that
strengthened the firm bonds of love and support, the glue that held the
family together.

Georgia's death brought to a halt research she was involved in to prepare a
paper about the women scientists of the Manhattan project for presentation
at the conference of the New Mexico Women in Science to be held in Santa Fe
in October.  I challenge one of you here today to take over that research
and present that paper at the Santa Fe meeting as a special tribute to
Georgia.

Georgia's dedication and achievements did not go unrecognized.  In 1986 and
again in 1993 she received, along with eleven other women, the governor's
award for outstanding New Mexico women.  Her citation reads:

"Georgia Fritz is honored as a woman who has actively worked to establish
and maintain a science and technology base in New Mexico via her own
professional achievements as an analytical chemist, and to enlarge this
base by working energetically and successfully to encourage young women to
embark upon science and technological careers."

Both awards were definitely earned and truly well-deserved.  Georgia's
legacy, however, does not consist exclusively of deeds done and goals
attained.  She has also left us a legacy of friendship, love, and laughter.
My own thirty year friendship with Georgia took on new meaning between the
time we first traded Peter and David stories and the time we did our gay
'90's routine from the stage of the old opera house on the outskirts of
Silver City, such friendship cannot be set aside abruptly.  I miss her
impromptu phone calls diverting me from some mundane chore with an
invitation to go with her to a lecture, a concert, or a play--often an
event she had just discovered in the monitor and scheduled to begin within
a few hours.  I miss her dry humor that often brought laughter from a group
on the verge of getting too frustrated by a difficult problem; but to
paraphrase a line from a popular Barbara Streisand song, "It's the laughter
I'll remember, whenever I remember, the way Georgia was."
