<P>The next meeting of the LAWIS Steering Committee will be Thursday, February
10, 2000 at 7:00 a.m. tentatively in Otowi Sideroom C. We've decided that
Thursdays at 7AM are a good time for everyone, so if you'd like to pry
open your eyes along with the rest of us earlybirds, please feel free to
do so. New Steering Committee Members are listed in the President's Soup&ccedil;on
below - so, you want to talk to one of us? All contact information for
LAWIS Steering Committee Members is available on the LAWIS Web Page, scrupulously
maintained by Tinka Gammel and Cathy Cleland. The list is located at (<A HREF="http://home.lanl.gov/lawis/NMNWSE_Northern.html">http://home.lanl.gov/lawis/NMNWSE_Northern.html</A>).
We're glad to hear from you.
<P><B>B.) PRESIDENT'S SOUP&Ccedil;ON: A MESSAGE FROM JANIE ENTER, LAWIS
PRESIDENT 2000</B>
<P>Welcome to the Year 2000! I hope your holidays were fun and joyful.
And thanks for your interest in Los Alamos Women in Science (LAWIS). We
have elected our 2000 Steering Committee members as follows:
<P>President: Janie Enter
<BR>Vice President (President/Elect for 2001): Cathy Cleland
<BR>Secretary: Ann Mauzy
<BR>Treasurer: Susana Delano
<BR>Membership: Cathy Cleland
<BR>LAWIS Newsletter: Laura McNamara
<BR>Expanding Your Horizons 2000 Chair: Alexine Salazar (Dolores Montano
and
<BR>Dana Roberson EYH Chairs/Elect for 2001)
<BR>Lunchtime Talks: Huyen Dinh
<BR>LAWIS Web Wizards: Cathy Cleland and Tinka Gammel
<BR>Members at Large: Mary Steincipher Campbell and Angelique Neuman
<P>Many kudos and thanks to the outgoing members of the 1999-2000 Steering
Committee:
<P>Cas Mason: Member at Large and coordinator of LAWIS and AAUW
<BR>collaborations (Congratulations on the celebration of 25 years at LANL!)
<BR>Amy Anderson: Secretary "extraordinaire"
<BR>Trish Wright: Treasurer "beyond compare"
<P>Also, there are two more ladies that, while their terms might "appear"
to be up, their dedication and commitment to LAWIS is reaffirmed by their
willingness to continue on the 2000 Steering Committee in their previous
capacities, mentoring their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s for their future success:
<P>Tinka Gammel: LAWIS Webpage Wizard
<BR>Alexine Salazar: EYH Chair
<P>All of these ladies helped LAWIS be an extremely successful organization
in the past year. They were instrumental in providing support and assistance
to women, both young and old, pursuing careers in engineering, math and
science, and acted as mentors and role models for these women. Those of
us left on the Steering Committee will sorely miss their expertise and
sagacious advice. We thank you.
<P>As President, I thank all of the members of the 1999 Steering Committee
for their commitment and hard work year. Since this was my first year on
the Steering Committee, I had lots to learn. Thanks for your patience and
understanding.
<P>As president of LAWIS, I am available for your suggestions, questions,
concerns, or if you just need someone to talk to. Feel free to contact
me at 665-0756 or via email at <A HREF="mailto:volcano@lanl.gov">volcano@lanl.gov</A>.
I look forward to working with all of you. Please let me know how I can
help LAWIS become an even better organization to meet the needs of a new
millennium!

<P><B>C.) LAWIS COMMUNITY OUTREACH ACTIVITIES</B>
<P><B>1.) LOS ALAMOS COUNTY SCIENCE FAIR</B><B></B>
<P>Historically LAWIS has supported the Los Alamos County Science Fair
and given awards in the following amounts: Ten $5.00 awards for honorary
mention; one 3rd place award of $10.00; one 2nd place award of $15.00,
and one 1st place award of $25.00. The amounts aren't changing, and neither
is the philosophy behind them: awards are given to encourage participation
in science, particularly among younger girls, and we keep the amounts small
to give out as many awards as possible. Tinka Gammel will be handing out
the prizes but would probably enjoy having company at the LA County Science
Fair on February 5th, 2000. It's fun! If you would like to help judge,
or if you want to organize "Northern Chapter" awards at your County's or
School District's Science Fair,&nbsp; contact Tinka Gammel, <A HREF="mailto:jtg@lanl.gov">jtg@lanl.gov</A>,
667-9149.
<P><B>2.) POJOAQUE AND TAOS SCIENCE FAIRS</B><B></B>
<P>Many thanks to the generous donor who anonymously gave LAWIS $100.00
to be used for even more science fair awards. The Steering Committee decided
that this extra award money should be used for branching out to science
fairs in other Northern New Mexico schools. And since Cas Mason was involved
in the science fairs at Pojoaque and Taos, we've started there. The Pojoaque
Intermediate School Science Fair took place on January 19th, 2000, with
entries from the 4th, 5th and 6th grades. Cas Mason, Julie Wilson and Andy
Montoya helped out as judges. Cas brings good tidings for the future: 'In
general, the standards were very high, making selections of WIS winners
difficult.'
<P>The results? Sixth grade winners were <B>Alexis Martinez </B>for '<B><I>Tapping
into the Sun</I></B>,' a project about wind powered electric turbines;
and <B>Maclovia Quintana</B>'s '<B><I>Chili Breakdown</I></B>,' which looked
at how fast chili can break down cholesterol. <B>Julia DePaula</B>'s fifth
grade winning project, entitled '<B><I>Do Birds of a Feather Use Color
Together?</I></B>' studied the feeding habits of magpies. Lastly, two fourth
graders, <B>Tess Montoya</B> and <B>Reida Powell</B>, each won a prize
for their projects '<B><I>Let the Sun Shine In</I></B>' and '<B><I>Bird
Diner</I></B>.' The first project explored the heat capacity of some natural
materials, while the second looked at what kind of bird food birds prefer
- just in case you're wondering, it's NOT bird food, but dog food - 'the
solid crunchy stuff,' Cas says. 'Magpies can handle it.' Hmmm! The Taos
Science Fair takes place on January 28th, and Cas will have a report for
us in the March issue. Congratulations to all the students who participated,
and especially to both teachers and judges for encouraging children to
be inquisitive about the world around them.
<P><B>3). EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS 2000</B><B></B>
<P>Awesome EYH chairperson Alexine Salazar is busy planning for this year's
EYH Conference, which will take place at the Oppenheimer Study Center on
Monday, March 6th, 2000, from 8:30 until 3:30. EYH is a great opportunity
to disrupt those nasty gender stereotypes that keep young women out of
the science and engineering pipeline. If you'd like more information, please
contact Alexine, 667-1785 or e-mail, <A HREF="mailto:alexine@lanl.gov">alexine@lanl.gov</A>.

<P><B>3.) OTHER COMMUNITY SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES</B><B></B>
<P><B>Careers And Curiosity At Espanola Middle School.</B> The Espanola
Middle School parent group has contacted Denise George of T-1 about offering
a Careers and Curiosity Day (<A HREF="http://home.lanl.gov/dcg/CC/C+C.html">http://home.lanl.gov/dcg/CC/C+C.html</A>)
for the seventh grade students at their school. The goal of Careers and
Curiosity is to foster interest of girls in science and math by providing
an interactive scientific experience guided by adult women who use math
and/or science in their careers. Presenters are asked to prepare a demonstration,
activity or display related to her career. This is a great way to share
your enthusiasm for your career with young people who are making important
decisions about their futures. Denise says this event is '...very energizing
and just plain fun!' But before she goes go too far along in the planning,
she'd like to make sure that she has the enough interested presenters for
a successful event. Some details:
<BR>- Date: Specific date TBA; probably a half-day in April at Espanola
Middle School.
<BR>- Training: Offered to new presenters (including suggestions and help
on designing the station).
<BR>- Format: The students (male and female) rotate through the stations
in small groups; each group spending on the average 5 minutes at a station.
This format has worked well in elementary schools in Los Alamos and Santa
Fe over the past several years. Denise believes it has the potential of
working well also for seventh grade students.
<BR>- Time: This is a Laboratory sponsored activity, so Laboratory employees
can charge time to community service!
<BR>- Contact: <B>If you are interested in helping out</B>, or just plain
intrigued by the whole concept, please e-mail to Denise: (<A HREF="mailto:dgeorge@lanl.gov">dgeorge@lanl.gov</A>),
or call her at work: 667-6248.
<P>You be the Judge... It's that time of year again when young minds searching
for the perfect science fair project need your guidance. The Laboratory
is asking that you take some time out of your busy schedule to <B>help
American Indian children learn about the wonders of science</B>. Somewhere
out is another Einstein or Hawking, and you might find her! There are several
schools in the state that need assistance, and if you would be interested
in helping out at a school science fair, please <B>contact Linda Anderman</B>
of CRO - <A HREF="mailto:anderman@lanl.gov">anderman@lanl.gov</A> or call
665-9196 for more information about what the schools need. If you decide
to help out, Linda will submit a list of names and contact information
to the appropriate organizations, and they will get in touch with you.
You can take personal time, be sponsored by your group or division, or
you may use community service time, which is covered under AM 322.21 -
just make sure it's pre-approved!
