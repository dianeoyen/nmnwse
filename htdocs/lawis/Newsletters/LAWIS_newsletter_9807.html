<H3><A NAME=ed></A>NOTE FROM THE EDITOR</H3>

<P>The July 1998 issue follows on the December 1997 issue.
Back issues to July 1996 are now available via the LAWIS home page!
I apologize for the long delay between the last newsletter and this
one: between organizing the LunchTalk Series, creating the new LAWIS
listserver, reorganizing the LAWIS web page, and of course doing my
research, I have been pretty busy! If you do not currently receive a
hardcopy of LAWIS mailings and would like to, or if you have any other
comments, corrections, or complaints, please let me know: without
feedback it is hard to improve!

<P>I have created a LAWIS listserver to help communication. (And to avoid
my inexcusable delay between newsletters!) If you are not on the email
distribution and would like to be, please send email to
lawis-request@maillist.lanl.gov to get an automated reply telling how to
(un)subscribe to and use the listserver (the content of the email will
be ignored). Postings should be sent to lawis@lanl.gov (automatically
forwarded, so please "pre-screen"), questions and comments should be
sent to me (owner-lawis@maillist.lanl.gov). Old postings (grouped by
month) are available via the listserver's "list" and "get" commands.
You do not need to be a LAWIS member to use the LAWIS mailserver, but
we do hope you'll consider becoming a member if you find it useful. For
my part, it has been exciting to see the response that requests for
volunteers have brought (interviewees for a PBS video on minorities,
speakers for Espanola schools, participants for a panel discussion on
careers for students in the Bridge program at UNMLA, etc), and to hear
about other programs and opportunities for women scientists.

<P>I now also manage the LAWIS home page: it's new location is
<a href="http://home.lanl.gov/lawis">http://home.lanl.gov/lawis</a>, (the old site should automatically send
you to this one; the NMNWSE home page is still at
<a href="http://ladmac.lanl.gov/NMNWSE/NMNWSE.html">http://ladmac.lanl.gov/NMNWSE/NMNWSE.html</a>). Please let me know if you
have any suggestions to improve the LAWIS home page (comments on the
state home page should go to the state Newsletter editor and web guru
Carol LaDelfe, cladelfe@lanl.gov). I would like to know if people who
currently receive the electronic Newsletter would prefer to only get an
email notice and pick up the Newsletter itself off the web. (This will
entail creating a separate list-server for the newsletter.) Further, a
variety of interesting links (sites for kids, the NMWSE Careers
booklet, a call for the New Mexico High School Supercomputing
Challenge, other WIS-oriented organizations, job ads, etc) are now
available from both the LAWIS and NMNWSE home pages, and interesting
links will no longer be reported in this Newsletter for brevity. Please
send me (or Carol LaDelfe for NMNWSE pages) any web/link updates,
additions, corrections, etc.

<P>Finally, I encourage you to buy a raffle ticket to help support
publication of the NMNWSE Careers booklet, which we give to EYH
participants. The drawing will be held at the State meeting October
23-25, 1998. I have tickets, or contact any board member. See our web
page, <a href="/home/lawis">http://home.lanl.gov/lawis</a>, for a link to the Careers booklet
and raffle including pictures of the items being raffled.

<HR> <H3><A NAME=pres></A>PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE</H3>

<P>Greetings!  Our Los Alamos Chapter (LAWIS) of the New Mexico Network
for Women in Science and Engineering (NMNWSE) had a wonderfully
successful "Expanding Your Horizons" Conference held here at the
Laboratory on March 15, 1998. Our organization has been sponsoring this
event since 1980. About 150 eighth- through tenth-grade female students
from nineteen schools in Northern New Mexico participated in workshops
presented by women scientists and engineers. The level of minority
participation was high and a significant number of Hispanic and native
American young women were present.  This year the students heard a very
special and dynamic presentation about the Mars Pathfinder Mission by
Linda Robeck, lead engineer for the Mars Lander, who is from the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.  Joyce Guzik (chair) and Alexine Salizar
(cochair) led this significant effort by our organization.  We want to
thank all of you in our organization who helped with this effort,
either as workshop presenters, "gofers", or with other
responsibilities.  You have helped ensure that a number of young people
have access to information on exciting and meaningful careers in
science and engineering.

<P>Speaking of career information, there is another success story to
report.  This year NMNWSE published "Careers:  Exploring the
Possibilities", a booklet that discusses over 30 careers in science and
engineering, all articles are authored by women, many of whom are from
our Northern Chapter of NMNWSE.  Our thanks is extended to Jennifer
Siders and Ann Mauzy for heading this project, and to many of our
members who contributed articles.  The information contained in this
booklet and some additional careers can be accessed on line at the
following Web site:  <a href="/home/lawis/careers.html">/home/lawis/careers.html</a>

<P>If you know of potential new members, consider inviting them to join us
at one of the LunchTalks or other events.  Encourage them to use this
organization to network with other LANL women in the sciences and
engineering.  Our web address for our Northern Chapter of NMNWSE is
<a href="/home/lawis">http://home.lanl.gov/lawis</a><br>
Check it out sometime.

<P>I enjoyed seeing many of you at our summer picnic!

<HR> <H3><A NAME=vpmsg></A>NOTE FROM THE VP</H3>

<P>The state-wide organization, New Mexico Network for Women in Science
and Engineering, of which Los Alamos Women in Science is the Northern
Chapter, will be electing new board members shortly. There is still
time to volunteer if you are interested in a board position.  Board
meetings are held every two months in different locations around the
state.  This past year we have met in Las Cruces, Alamogordo,
Albuquerque, Socorro (State Science Fair) and Silver City. Meetings are
always on Saturdays and usually in the morning from 10-12.

<P>I have served on both the state and local Boards for two
years and I have to say that the Network has really helped me a lot.
The other women on the Board are great friends and mentors.  Serving on
the Board was a great opportunity and the networking that I did while
on the Board helped me get a job, as well as strengthen my resume.  I
can't recommend this enough for other postdocs or staff.

<P>I will be leaving for a new job in San Diego shortly, and look forward
to getting involved with Women in Science organizations there.

<P>[Editors Note: despite my delay in getting this newsletter out, state
(and local!) board volunteers are still welcomed. Please contact any
board member to inquire about getting involved in NMNWSE or LAWIS
activities, or contact me (jtg@lanl.gov, 7-9149) and I will pass your
name along.]

<HR> <H3><A NAME=byktw></A>VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT FOR BRING YOUR KIDS TO WORK DAY</H3>

<P> Georgia A. Pedicini, CIC-7 MS B294 LANL, 667-8117, gap@lanl.gov, is on
the organizing committee for "Take Your Children To Work Day", which is
scheduled for Thursday August 13th.  She  contacted LAWIS to see if we
wanted to do something.  The LAWIS steering committee decided to
encourage individual members to participate rather than having an
official LAWIS activity.  If you would like to do a demo, or help in
any way, contact Georgia (there is still plenty of time to volunteer!).
Last year Denise George and I (Tinka Gammel) staffed two "LAWIS
demo's".  Denise did "The Math of Toys" (she and I brought in all our
toys and let the kids play, trying to make the contact with the
scientific/mathematical principles the toys use when talking with the
kids). I did "Magnets" (a bunch of big and small magnets, paper, iron
filings, and a small poster the kids ignore explaining why making a
mess with magnets is science).  Unfortunately, I will not be in town,
but if anyone wants to use my "Magnets" demo (VERY simple, and the kids
like it: magnets, iron filings, and a small poster the kids ignore
explaining why playing with magnets is science), I'm happy to lend it
out. As I am leaving soon, I left it with Denise George, so please
contact her to borrow it (dgeorge@lanl.gov, 7-6248). Denise is
tentatively also going to repeat "The Math of Toys", and would
appreciate help (basically helping the kids solve the puzzles if they
get stuck, and trying to point out how math concepts such as topology
are used to make the toy).

<HR> <H3><A NAME=eyh></A>EYH REPORT: A SUCCESSFUL WORKSHOP!</H3>

<P>by Joyce Guzik, EYH co-chair

<P>The Los Alamos Women in Science hosted their 20th Annual Expanding Your
Horizons conference at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Wednesday, March
25, 1998.  Approximately 130 middle and high school girls and 25 adult
teachers and sponsors from as many schools attended the program.  The
program was funded by donations by many divisions and groups from Los
Alamos National Laboratory, as well as statewide and local
businesses.   The girls participated in a team activity in the morning,
an "egg drop", in which they were asked to build egg-cradling
containers out of a sheet of paper, soda straws, and tape that would
prevent their eggs from breaking while being dropped from increasing
heights.  The girls then participated in morning and afternoon hands-on
workshops in small groups, with women scientists and engineers from
around the lab, in addition to medical professionals from the
community.

<P>The program concluded with a presentation including slides and a video
by guest speaker Linda S. Robeck, a mechanical engineer at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.  Linda was in charge of
the team that assembled the Lander part of the Mars Pathfinder mission
that landed on and explored the geology of Mars last July.  Linda
Robeck's talk was very well received by the girls and adults alike;
unlike previous years, most of the participants stayed until the very
end of the program at 3:30.  Linda brought a poster of Mars' surface
taken by the lander, and 3D glasses for viewing Mars' landscape.  She
also handed out very nice information postcards about the project.
Linda's talk at the Bradbury science museum was also well attended;
Linda gave her talk twice to accommodate the overflow crowd.  The talk
and Expanding Your Horizons was publicized in the laboratory on-line
Newsbulletin, Los Alamos Monitor, and Santa Fe New Mexican, and covered
in detail with photos in the Monitor.  It is evident that Linda takes
very seriously speaking to school groups, in particular groups of young
women; she had six such engagements scheduled for March, and averages
two talks per month.  She also has a wonderful sense of humor, and gave
us all a very good idea of what it was like to be in charge of
assembling the Mars lander, including the extensive testing and
numerous setbacks to take in stride when something went wrong or was
overlooked, all under the pressure of the launch window deadline.

<P>Overall, the program was a great success, and we are looking forward to
next year.

<HR> <H3><A NAME=LACSF></A>LAWIS AWARDS AT LA COUNTY SCIENCE FAIR</H3>

<P>The 1998 Los Alamos County Science Fair was held February 6-7.  Joyce
Guzik, Tinka Gammel, Pat Berger, Ginger Young, and Beki Warren
judged the LAWIS awards.  Talking with all the students was great fun,
and as usual, it was very difficult to decide who should receive awards
among so many excellent projects. We tried to err on the side of
encouraging younger kids, and we also coordinated our awards with AAUW
in order that more girls could receive awards. 1-3rd place received a
($25,$15,$10) gift certificate to Otowi Station, and at Denise George's
suggestion, this year we instituted that the 11 honorable mentions also
received a $5 gift certificate.  (We planned to give only 10, but the
projects were all so good!) A Mars postcard left over from Linda
Robeck's talk, a "Trust me, I'm a Scientist" bumper sticker, and a
certificate on dinosaur paper was also given to each winner. (As usual,
Otowi Station gave us a discount on all items purchased there, for
which we are grateful.) The winning projects were:<br>
<LI> 1st: Katie Wurden, "Pieces of pi";<br>
<LI> 2nd: Claire Lackner, "Collecting CO_2 from the Air";<br>
<LI> 3rd: Kristin White, "Fire Light, Fire Bright";<br>
Honorable Mention:<br>
<LI> Heather Altherr, "Digging Magnetism";<br>
<LI> Betsy Nichols, "Heart Throbs: A Comparison of Athletes, Guys and Gals";<br>
<LI> Rima Turner, "The Powers of the Towers of Hanoi", and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  "What Growing Medium Do Scarlet Runner Beans Like Best?";<br>
<LI> Jessica Chipera, "Experimenting With Cars";<br>
<LI> Kristen Hemphill, "Is It Food or Is It Water?";<br>
<LI> Micah Sims, "Solar Hot Water Heater";<br>
<LI> Jennifer Trent, "Friction of Different Materials";<br>
<LI> Kiran Chitanvis, "The Effect of Acid Rain on Plant Growth";<br>
<LI> Erin Smith, "Water From Fire?!!!!";<br>
<LI> Kimberly Vela, "Liquid Properties and Crystal Growth";<br>
<LI> Erin Dempsey, "Comparison of Household Cleaners".<br>
You may recognize some of these names from last year, and
we hope to see them again next year!

<P>Thank You's received (or at least the ones forwarded to me):

<P>Claire Lackner:<br>
I am honored by your recognition of my science project this year. I
hope that I will someday be a Woman in Science, too. Thank you too for
the gift certificate. I will put it to good use.
[Claire also receive an award from Pajarito Astronomers, and is
interested in astrophysics.]

<P>Jessica Chipera (4th Grade):<br>
Dear Fellow Science Lovers,<br>
I was excited excited when I heard that I received an award
from your group. Thank you for the gift certificate.
I am honored to receive acknowledgement from your group.

<P>Betsy Nichols:<br>
Thanks you for the $5.00 from the Los Alamos Women in Science for my
Science Fair Project called "Heart Throbs: A Comparison of Athletes,
Guys and Gals". I appreciate it very much. I had a lot of fun doing
my Science Fair Project. I am glad you liked it.

<HR> <H3><A NAME=lunch></A>NOTES FROM THE LUNCHTALKS AND OTHER LAWIS ACTIVITIES</H3>

<P>Laura Kraemer, PA-4, LANL, kicked off the LAWIS Lunch-Time Talks for
1998 with her talk on Jan. 13 about her experiences serving in
AmeriCorps.  Laura gave an overview of the program she was in, the
National Civilian Community Corps, as well as mentioning other programs
under the AmeriCorps umbrella (see <a href="http://www.americorps.org">http://www.americorps.org</a>). Laura's
parents were peace-corps volunteers, and encouraged Laura in her choice
to devote part of her time to helping others. Laura was also influenced
by Theresa Adams Muranaka, an archeaologist and professor of
anthropology at SDSU.  It is hard to summarize the diverse experiences
Laura related: from teaching English in Romania, to cleaning trash from
arroyos in San Diego, CA, to building fish weirs in Tacoma, WA; suffice
it to say it was fascinating. Despite occasional hard times, Laura
highly recommended that everyone considering serving the community
through programs like these. Locally she recommended considering the
"Habitat for Humanity" program (in Espanola, 747-2690).  Laura was at
LANL as an UGS, and is now studying veterinary medicine, but she left
literature on these programs, and I will be happy to forward a copy to
you if you are interested.

<P>On Feb 12, Ann Pendergrass, ESH-3, LANL, spoke about her career in the
field of Safety Analysis. Ann started out in a quite different field:
she studied marine biology as an undergraduate, and her doctorate is in
Postharvest Physiology (plant growth). She said if she knew she could
live and work in a place as nice as Los Alamos, it would have been more
efficient have studied nuclear physics and engineering, but she would
have missed an enjoyable journey through varied careers.  Having a
background in research, she was able to a very amusing charicature of
the typical scientist mad at having to take safety training when they
had "been doing it for 30 years".  Ann stressed that Safety Analysis
has applications in everything we do, and exists to help people
identify hazards in the workplace and minimize risks. A proper safety
analysis not only protects the worker, but also helps eliminate
spurious results (eg, by identifying sources of possible contamination
and developing procedures to minimize the risk), and protects the
equipment (eg, from power surges due to inadequate wiring). She
illustrated her point with several examples, including design of the
drums and equipment for drum handling for shipments to WIPP (the Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant, which LAWIS toured in April). Ann welcomes
dialog to make the safety process at LANL more helpful and less
something researchers view as a hinderance.

<P>On March 12, Teralene Foxx, ESH-20, LANL, spoke on "Birds, Bats, and
Bees: An Ecologist's view of why they are important to the Laboratory".
Teralene got her start as an ecologist growing up in a prarie with a
mother who "was not afraid of snakes". She also was lucky to have some
good teachers, although when she got to Kansas State University she was
hit with the reality of women in science: her research professor
"didn't want women". Teralene made it her goal that he accept women,
and was successful. Eventually she ended up at LANL studying endangered
species on lab lands; many members of her team working on the LANL
site-wide Environmental Impact Statement were in the audience. She
showed pictures of several of the sensitive, threatened, and endangered
species that live on lab grounds (spotted owl, Jemez salamander,
peregrin falcon, etc). Teralene pointed out that protecting and
monitoring the local environment is important to the laboratory not
just as we need to be in compliance with environmental regulations, but
also as a tool to recruit people (scenic local/quality of life), and as
a sensitive measure of whether LANL is providing a "safe, healthy
workplace". Teralene stressed that each of us has a responsibility to
see how our own programs affect the lab; ESH should not act as a
policeman, but rather should "provide tools" to assess the
environmental impact of a particular program. She also communicated a
bit of her own passion for the organisms that live here, and for
learning how to take care of them.  If you are interested in finding
out more about plants and animals on laboratory lands, Teralene has
recently completed the Annotated Checklist and Database for Vascular
Plants of the Jemez Mountains (available via the LANL library at
<a href="http://lib-www.lanl.gov/la-pubs/00412761.pdf">http://lib-www.lanl.gov/la-pubs/00412761.pdf</a>; see also
<a href="http://lib-www.lanl.gov/pubs/Environment.htm">http://lib-www.lanl.gov/pubs/Environment.htm</a> for a listing of LANL
environmental publications, including an atlas of breeding birds, a
report on local bats, and information on fungi in Los Alamos county).
Contact Teralene if you'd like more information on LANL's environmental
programs.

<P>On April 3-4, several LAWIS members, with some friends and family,
drove down to Carlsbad to tour the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP),
see Carlsbad Caverns, and visit Trinity Site. It was an especially
meaningful trip for me as it was my 40th birthday. (The other people on
the trip surprised me with small gifts and a cake - Thanks!!) At WIPP,
we first got an informative tour of the above ground facilities and the
purpose of WIPP. We then went below ground, where we could see where
the waste would actually be stored.  We were allowed to take home some
salt cores as souveneirs.  I found especially interesting that one
could already see in the older passages that the salt was already
starting to creep in and seal the room.  Some of us then went to
Carlsbad Caverns for a guided tour of Lower Cave, where we had to wear
hard hats, but didn't have to crawl in the mud (unfortunately that tour
was already full....).  The next morning we headed out for Trinity
site.  Unfortunately it was an extremely windy day, but nonetheless it
was interesting to see where the first atomic bomb exploded, and to see
the large crowds.  A few of us returned to Carlsbad Caverns for a tour
of Slaughter Canyon Cave aftering touring Trinity Site.  Everyone
reports to have had a great time.  Several people wanted to come but
couldn't make it this time; there seems to be enough interest to try a
combined Trinity Site/Geology field trip or a Carlsbad Cavern Tour
again in a year or two. It was also suggested that NMNWSE try a
"State Field Trip" sometime.

<P>On April 7, Jan Frigo, NIS-1, LANL, gave the next LunchTalk on
"Biologically Motivationed Autonomous Vehicle Control", which I
subtitled "Robot Bugs Conquer Earth". Jan explained a bit about how
these robot bugs are made and brought several "bugs". A single
oscillating LRC circuit mimics the wings of a butterfly. Two
solar-powered circuits can lead to a "light-seeking bug". Understanding
and controlling this "bug behavior" is important to LANL for design of
remote handling systems for hazardous material, but also has
implications in other fields, including of course understanding real
bugs. The audience was small, but there were lots of questions and Jan
let us try the bugs ourselves.  I am afraid I was having so much fun I
did not take good notes: I can see why her "Expanding Your Horizons"
workshop on this topic got such rave reviews!

<P>On April 16, Carol Hogsett, GRA Representative at LANL and geologist by
training (you may remember the excellent talk she gave to LAWIS last
fall), conducting a tour to the Jemez and the Milagro Gamma Ray Burst
Observatory for several SERS/URS students here at LANL.  She graciously
volunteered to make this a LAWIS event as well.  While there was a lot
of interest in this field trip, due to various conflicts only two
of us ended up being able to go. I am trying to arrange a repeat
by Carol, or one of the several other LAWIS members who are geologists,
hopefully in the next month or two.

<P>On May 14, Wendee Brunish reported on the 25th anniversary conference
on Women in Science and Engineering: Choices and Successes, sponsored
by the New York Academy of Sciences, which she attended.  Her summary
of the conference follows as the next article.

<P>On June 11, Jeanne Fair, EES-15, LANL, spoke on "The Ecological and
Physiological Cost of Contaminants on Cavity Nesting Birds".  Jeanne is
one of the people responsible for the bird-houses with the
"environmental monitoring station" signs you may have noticed on many
of the local trails, and she spoke about what she has learned so far
from this study. (Jeanne works with Teralene Foxx who spoke in March,
and can also be contacted to learn more about the environmental studies
of plants and animals being done at LANL.) As nestlings go from a few
grams to adult weight in a few weeks, they are very susceptible to
environmental influences during this period, and hence nestling health
and survival is a good indicator for environmental stress or
contamination.  Jeanne noted that birds have a very poor sense of smell
and so one can investigate the nests for ticks, lice, and other
parasites, and weigh, measure and take blood from the nestlings, etc,
without causing the nest to be abandoned. With approximately 450
birdboxes, this is the largest study of it's kind in N. America.  The
most common birds to take residence in the boxes were western bluebirds
("they just like the boxes") and ash-throated flycatchers (previously
unstudied, so a scientific bonus).  The flycatcher leaves the nest
later and needs 22% more energy in the nest, so bluebirds do slightly
better in stressful conditions like arid NM. Jeanne found that the
bluebirds died mostly from predation, 82% hatched, 83% fledged, whereas
for flycatchers the main cause of death is starvation, 77% hatched, 72%
fledged. Bird malaria was the most common blood parasite for both. As
blood was collected, Jeanne is also studying gene flow between canyons,
another bonus for bird research.  Jeanne has yet to correlate the data
she took with known contaminants in the areas where the boxes were
situated, and against the control boxes in uncontaminated areas. I am
looking forward to learning the answer in a future talk!

<P>On July 8, Betty Harris, NMT-1 CMR, LANL, spoke on "Sensitivity of Once
Shocked, Weathered, High Explosives" - work she has been doing in the
context of the Environmental Restoration Project at LANL after noticing
that some nominally non-explosive pink material found at a firing site
was explosive (PBX-9007). Betty collected chunks of high-energy
explosives (referred to as HE, not HEE) from various sites around the
lab where HE work has resulted in extensive contamination of the soil,
sanitary drain systems, storage tanks, buildings, etc. Betty found a
wide variation in the sensitivity of the HE as compared to their
nominal sensitivity, as measured by flame tests, drop weight impact
tests, spark tests, etc. (Betty explained these tests.) However,
except for a few organic HE's (such as cyclotol, which broke down into
nonexplosive but toxic compounds), it appeared that this variation was
due more to variations in manufacture and lack of standardization of
the tests than due to weathering. This is because most HE's (eg, HMX, a
typical HE used at LANL) are fairly stable unless shocked, and hence
not subject to weathering.  However, Betty did state that they did not
separately test the outer surface of the HE chunks collected, and there
may be surface effects which they would not have observed. So pay
attention to those warning signs around the lab: HE's don't "go away".
On the positive side, only deflagration, not explosion, is expected
from modern HE's without engineering for weapons use.

<P>The LAWIS Summer picnic was held at noon on July 10 at Ashley Pond.
Luckily it was a nice day, and about 30 people attended. Most people
agreed the new lunch time format (as opposed to the traditional late
afternoon picnic) was a good idea. LAWIS provided a giant submarine
sandwich, and we shared potluck side dishes and deserts. The quilts
being raffled by NMNWSE to support EYH activities were displayed, and
$58 worth of raffle tickets were sold! I think everyone had a good
time, and I also noticed some networking going on: an overall success!

<P>The next lunchtalk is Aug. 4. At 12 noon in Otowi sideroom C, Joyce
Guzik, X-TA, LANL, will speak on "Massive Exploding Stars". I hope to
see you there!

<HR> <H3><A NAME=WIST></A>WOMEN IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: CHOICES AND SUCCESSES</H3>

<P>Wendee M.  Brunish for Los Alamos Women in Science

<P>On March 12 and 13, 1998, I attended a meeting hosted by the New York
Academy of Sciences on Women in Science and Technology: Choices and
Successes.  The purpose of this meeting, which marked the 25th
anniversary of an earlier meeting on women in science, was to discuss
barriers and success strategies that have emerged over the last two and
a half decades.  Some of the issues that affect women in science
include the "leaky" pipeline and the "two-body" problem.  Other issues
discussed include the perception of good science vs. "female" science,
and the affect of hostile climates on women scientists.  The meeting
attracted many interesting and famous women speakers, including Dr.
Gertrude B. Elion, Nobel Laureate in Medicine, Sheila Tobias, Author of
"They're Not Dumb, They're Different", Judy Franz, Executive Officer,
American Physical Society, and Paula Rayman, Director, Radcliffe Public
Policy Institute.

<P>The meeting began with a brief overview of the current status of women
in the workplace. Women are still underrepresented in science (22%) and
engineering (8%).  The numbers are fairly high in the 'softer' sciences
like biology, and lower in the "hard sciences" like physics, and lowest
in engineering.  Overall, women earn about three-quarters of what men
earn, with about half of this discrepancy being related to education
level and job content. In both industry and academia, women are
generally one full step behind their male counterparts.  These means
that women with the same education and years of experience as their
male counterparts will, for example, attain the assistant professor
rank at about the same time as their male counterpart becomes an
associate professor.  However, surveys indicate that, among scientists,
women place just as much value on their careers as men do.

<P>The discussion of the "leaky" pipeline was led by Paula Rayman of the
Radcliffe Public Policy Institute, and concluded that access is not
enough.  Attrition rates for women in science continue to exceed that
for men (56% vs. 39%) even when corrected to compare those with equal
abilities.  Whenever access opens up, women enter fields in increased
numbers, but continued progress is not inevitable.  For instance, when
graduate programs were opened to women between the 1900's and the
1920's, the numbers increased rapidly.  But subsequently, from the
1930's to 1960's, there was a decline in the percentage of women in
these programs.  When the new technology of computer sciences was
developing, women entered the field in record numbers, reaching an
all-time high of 40% women.  But as the field matured and became more
structured and traditional hierarchies became entrenched, the numbers
dropped quickly to the 23%.  The lesson is that achieving a "critical
mass" is an elusive goal. Although it is tempting to believe that once
women enter a field in sufficient numbers the climate will change and
be more welcoming to women, past experience does not always bear this
out.

<P>The two-body problem for women in science was discussed by Mary C.
Mattis, Catalyst, Inc., a company that conducts many surveys on women
in scientific and technical fields.  Despite the relaxing of
stereotyped roles, women continue to bear a heavier share of
home/family responsibilities, even when both spouses work full time and
the woman makes as much or more money than her husband.  Women
scientists are more likely than men scientists to have a full-time
working spouse.  Moreover,  women scientists are much more likely than
men scientists to have a scientist spouse.  Women scientists who are
married virtually always have a spouse whose career is as demanding and
absorbing as theirs is.  This means that few women scientists are in
the position that many male scientists are of having a spouse who does
not work or who works part-time, and can therefore shoulder more of the
home and family responsibilities.  To complicate matters further, many
women are reluctant to cede homemaking and child-rearing
responsibilities to their partners, feeling threatened or
"de-feminized" by the loss of this traditionally female prerogative.

<P>Gerald Holton of Harvard University reported on his research into
whether "female" science was different from and/or inferior to
traditional science.  For centuries, the dominant scientific style has
been "bonding through competitiveness", but women may be less
comfortable competing.  Instead women historically prefer collaboration
and consensus. Women are more apt to say that they are very concerned
about honesty and integrity in their work.  In their research female
scientists also strive more for synthesis, comprehensiveness, and
thoroughness.  As a result, many women scientist have fewer
publications but more citations.  This style may work against women
when traditional evaluation methods for hiring and tenure are used,
such as number of publications.

<P>Under a pilot program put together by the American Physical Society, a
small team led by Judy Franz performed climate surveys by invitation of
graduate physics departments.  Not surprisingly, they found that what
both women and men wanted was to feel like "valued members of the
community".  However, many women cited a "litany of small indignities"
that they experienced in graduate school or in their workplace.  Women
often reported that felt isolated, and had difficulty finding an
effective mentor.  They also reported that they felt excluded from many
informal social and networking opportunities, and that they did not
feel that they had as much political know-how as their male
counterparts.  Follow-up surveys found that dramatic improvements in
climate could be effected through relatively simple and inexpensive
measures.  The key seemed to be an elevated awareness combined with a
visible commitment to improvement by top managers.

<P>Women scientists who had succeeded in a variety of fields and
organizations were asked what strategies they had used to succeed.  The
most commonly cited, by almost three-quarters of the respondents, was
to exceed the expectations of their peers and managers.  Almost half of
the women recommended seeking out and taking on challenging
assignments, while an equal number suggested taking steps to make males
comfortable in their presence.  Others necessary qualities included
persistence, resiliency, and self-confidence, having the wisdom to
choose one's battles, and being able to find effective role models,
mentors, and sponsors.  The rewards that women scientists who succeeded
valued most were very similar to those cited by men and included money,
power, and increased self-confidence.  Other rewards included being
able to make a difference, and having the opportunity to teach and
mentor others.  Finally, being able to set and achieve goals, and
finding ways to balance work and family demands were also mentioned
as very gratifying by successful women scientists.

<P>Based on surveys of science and technology companies who have been
extremely successful in their attempts to hire, retain, and develop
women, the following success strategies for organizations.  One
important guideline is to focus on retention and promotion, not just
recruiting.  Equally important is to institute flexible policies that
contribute to work/family balance.  It is also vital to provide a
demonstrated management commitment to eliminating hostile climates.
Managers at all levels must take steps to prevent women from becoming
isolated by ensuring that women are included in all formal and informal
communication networks.  And finally, the organization should encourage
and reward women who serve as role models, mentors, and sponsors.

<P>The current status was summed up with the results of a survey of 60
science and technology companies about where the ranked on a scale
measuring the acceptance of women in the workplace.  One-third of the
respondents characterized themselves as being in the first or second
stage, which occur, respectively, when women remain isolated and when
they seek to emulate men to gain acceptance.  The next stage, where
women are present in high enough numbers to begin to challenge the
status quo, was reported by fully 60% of the respondents.  Four
companies reported that women are integrated into the workforce and
respected by their co-workers and managers, while none claimed to be in
the final stage, where gender becomes irrelevant.

<P>To summarize some of what I heard during the two-day conference,
progress continues on many fronts.  However, without continued efforts,
success is not assured.  Many obstacles still exist that make it
difficult for women to pursue a successful career in science and
technology.  Major barriers to success for women scientists include the
lack of suitable mentors, role models, and sponsors for female
scientists, the continuing existence in many places of a hostile work
environment (although in most cases this environment was caused by
ignorance rather than malice), and the lack of policies and resources
to ease family/work balance conflicts (exacerbated by the prevalence of
the two-body problem for women). Other issues included exclusion from
networking, lack of political know-how, and the fact that male
scientists and managers often felt less comfortable working with women
than with men.  Women who are succeeding do so by dint of hard work,
perseverance, and careful selection of mentors and sponsors who could
help them in their careers.

<HR> <H3><A NAME=bites></A>FORENSIC DENTISTRY: BITE MARKS AND PHYSICAL ABUSE</H3>

<P>From: DreamDoc13 &lt;DreamDoc13@aol.com&gt;
Date: Thu, 7 May 1998<br>
Subject: Sharing my expertise and mentoring

<P>As a woman in the field of dentistry, I was surprised at what a natural
choice this field would be for women with an aptitude for science and
the arts.  The field remains predominantly male.  In addition,
information about certain specialties remains difficult if not
impossible to acquire.  My area of specialty is forensic studies.  I am
currently preparing to seek board accredidation as a Forensic
Odontologist and have trained with the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology as well as with  Northwestern University and the University
of Texas in San Antonio.  The field encompasses the identification of
remains of missing persons, identification of remains from disasters,
as well as the identification of bite marks left by abusers on living
or deceased individuals.  Bite marks (so much in the media these days)
can frequently be the heaviest piece of evidence used to convict or
acquit alledged perpetrators of physical abuse.

<P>If you feel that I can share my knowledge and help mentor a woman to
study the field or perhaps others as to the proper documentation of
bite marks and their use in conviction, please correspond.  There is
additional information available at my web page
(www.the-toothfairy.com) and my aol address is Dreamdoc13@aol.com.

<P>Thank you for your time.<br>
Dr. Marianne Schaefer
