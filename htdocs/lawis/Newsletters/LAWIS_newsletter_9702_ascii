RETIRING PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
----------------------------

I would like to thank the membership for allowing me to be the
President of LAWIS for the last year. My term extended longer than a
year but now is the time for it to end. I will be taking maternity
leave in March and Carol LaDelfe has volunteered to step in as
President until fall, when a new president will be elected. I hope that
the membership will support Carol in her plans for future activities.
Some of our future activities include luncheon speakers for the
membership. This will provide a great opportunity for members to get to
know each other better. I hope you will try it out. I look forward to
joining in the fun when I return from my leave.

ACTING PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
--------------------------

Greetings!  I've not yet gotten used to the idea of being acting
President, but Karen assures me "There's nothing to it!"  We have a
meeting next Tuesday, to hear Bev Larson tell us about "Anthropology as
Science at LANL" and I hope to see many of you there. I hope we can
look forward to a series of similarly enlightening topics to be shared
in this way.

Our big effort in the next month is the "Expanding Your Horizons"
Conference to be held here at the Laboratory on March 20th. We can
still use help, both Workshop presenters and "gofers."  Call Joyce
Guzik (7-8927) if you have or can make time to help.

I'll need some help in doing this job.  Be sure to let me know if you
have issues that need attention, or if you have a problem that we might
be able to look into.  I will continue as Membership Chair, as that
does not take a great deal of time. Thanks, and I look forward to
continuing this year's activities that Karen has so ably set in
motion.

REPORT FROM THE STATE BOARD MEETING
-----------------------------------

The latest State Board meeting was held on February 8th at Debby
Potter's house in Albuquerque. The Northern chapter had a number of
representatives present including Lynda Towers, State President; Karen
Schultz Paige, Northern Chapter President; Carol LaDelfe; State
Newsletter editor; Deborah Kubicek, State Treasurer; and Jennifer
Siders; State Secretary.

Most of the discussion focussed on the Expanding Your Horizons
conferences.  For most chapters, the EYH conferences are approaching.
The Southern chapter just recently finished their conference. It
sounded like it was a very successful conference, well attended by
young women, with lots of interesting workshops. As usual, we are all
relieved when one of groups has a successful EYH conference.

Yolanda Jones-King is the State Board's fundraising chairperson and has
done a great job raising money for EYH on a state-wide level. After
presenting our budget to the State Board, we received a $300
contribution from the State Board to put toward our EYH activities this
year. That will help us as we gear up for our EYH conference in March.

The Southern chapter discussed their plans for the Annual Meeting this
fall. The meeting will be held in Las Cruces. The date has not yet been
set, because they are still searching for a hotel or conference
center.  They have eliminated the weekends of Balloon Fiesta and the
AAUW annual meeting. They are hoping that lots of members from across
the state will be attending.

The next State Board meeting will be April 5 in Socorro.

LA COUNTY SCIENCE FAIR: AWARDS BY LAWIS, AND LESSONS LEARNED
------------------------------------------------------------

Three of us, Joyce Guzik, Tinka Gammel, and Ginger Young, judged the
Los Alamos County Science Fair February 7-8, 1997, on behalf of LAWIS.
We awarded $25, $15, and $10 Otowi Station gift certificates for
1st-3rd place to female participants.  In addition, we awarded 10
honorable mention certificates including stickers saying "BACK OFF
MAN!  I'M A SCIENTIST", which Tinka purchased at discount from Otowi
Station.

The winners were:

1st Place:  Joanna Mattis, 7th grade, The Shocking Truth of Magnetism

2nd Place:  Rebecca Hammon, 8th grade, Electroplating Steel

3rd Place:  Naomi Gilna (7th grade) and Kate Stroh (6th grade), Does Asthma
            Affect Heart Rate in Everyday Competitive Swimming?

Honorable Mention:

Karen Rand and Racheal Severinghaus, 6th grade, Biodegradability
Liz Solano, 6th grade, Palindrome Patterns
Jillian Erickson,7th grade,  A Day in the Life of My Blood Pressure
Leanne Juzaitis and Katy McGhee, 6th grade, Volcanos
Monica Michelotti, 7th grade, Dendrochronology of Precipitation in
       Ponderosa Pine
Leigh Schanfein, 8th grade, Manure:  Which Will Give You the Greenest Thumb?
Alexis Smith, 4th grade, Surfing the Science Fair
S. Christensen, 5th grade, Drip-Drip Spill
Kristin White, 5th grade, Riches from the Earth
Shannon Matzke, 5th grade, Colored Rain

Following are suggestions and information that we hope future judges
will find useful for next year:

1)  We started judging on Friday evening at 7 pm at the Pueblo
complex.  At this time the entrants are NOT present.  The judges can
also return Saturday morning, between 8 am and noon, when the 7th grade
and older participants are required to be present to explain their
projects and answer questions.

2) The names and grade levels of the entrants are on the BACK of the
numbered cards in front of the displays (as veteran judge Ginger Young
pointed out too late for me to take advantage of!).  This is important
to know to find out if the entrants are girls or boys, and judge the
quality versus age.

3)  It made a big difference in our decision to return on Saturday and
interview prospective winners.  This is also valuable to the
participants, as we can encourage them and give them suggestions for
improving their projects for the regional fair, or for next year.  This
requires that the judges allot approx. 2 hours Friday night, and
another 2 hours or so on Saturday morning to do an adequate job.

4)  We have set ourselves a difficult task by not limiting the awards
to a topic or age level.  It is difficult for all of the judges to look
at all of the projects in a reasonable amount of time.  We suggest
having at least 3 judges, splitting the room into sections, and having
each judge pick the best one or two entries from their section.

5)  The Science Fair Officials present the awards Saturday afternoon at
4pm, in the Civic Auditorium.  They call the winners to the stage in
groups according to the first letter of their last name.  Persons
giving awards are invited to sit on the stage and give the awards to
winners personally.  This year Tinka and I sat on the stage, and Tinka
presented the awards on our behalf.  The science fair officials also
make certificates to give to each winner, but we recommend that LAWIS
also give certificates, because they can run short or inadvertently
miss someone.  (Tinka made beautiful certificates between noon and 4 pm
on Saturday).

6)  Members of the AAUW give out awards for Elementary School
participants.  They wanted to coordinate with us to avoid giving all of
the awards to the same girls.  This year we did not overlap in our
decisions, but I don't know that overlap should necessarily be
completely avoided.

It really is a lot of fun to judge the science fair.  We learned many
interesting things, were impressed by creative ideas and persistence,
and inspired by the enthusiasm of many of the girls as they explained
their projects.  It's nice to remember why we chose careers in
science!

This year we decided to provide lunch to the participants
    and are having a "cookout" on-site

We are still in need of volunteers, especially

1)  Workshop presenters
2)  "Gophers" to help workshop presenters
3)  Help with activities during the day
4)  Help assembling the registration packets on Friday, March 14.
5)  Volunteers to help any of the committee chairs with their work.

If you would be willing to help with any of these, please contact
Joyce Guzik (joy@lanl.gov, 7-8927).

Thank you to everyone who has pitched in to help so far!

LAWIS LUNCHES STARTED
---------------------

Bev Larson gave an excellent talk on "Anthropology as Science at LANL"
(and I apologize for spelling her name wrong and misquoting her title
in the previous mailing). Despite the small audience, I think it was an
excellent kick-off to the "LAWIS Lunch-Time Talks". She described why
LANL has an anthropologist, gave a brief description of the changing
role of anthropology in light of the current societal weighting of
gaining scientific information versus protecting the rights and beliefs
of the living descendants, and showed slides of an excavation of a
multiple-room pueblo done at L-site prior to the ruin being covered by
a LANL structure.

The next Lunch-Time Talk is scheduled for noon, Friday March 14, also
in Otowi sideroom A, with the speaker not yet determined. I hope to see
you there.  Volunteers and suggestions for future speakers are
welcome.
