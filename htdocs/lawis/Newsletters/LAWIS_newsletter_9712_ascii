I'd like to begin by thanking the outgoing Board Members, and
welcoming the new Board Members: I look forward to working with
you. Work has already begun on our main activity for the year,
hosting the "Expanding Your Horizons" Workshop, and I encourage
all members to think about helping. The commitee updating the
"Surveying Your Future, nontraditional careers for young
women" booklet has been making progress and I look forward
to seeing the revised version. As your new President, I am open to
suggestions to make LAWIS a better organization to meet

HOLIDAY CHEER
-------------

For those of you who missed the LAWIS Holiday party,
Ann Mauzy sends the following ``Holiday Cheer":

    THE NIGHT BEFORE DEFENCE
       (or A Visit From Citrate)

    Twas the night before defence, when all through the lab
    Not a gel box was shaking, with stain or with MAb;
    The columns were hung in the cold room with care,
    In hopes that my protein, I soon could prepare;

    The post-docs were nestled all smug in their beds,
    While extracts of barley muddled their heads;
    With the tech in the suburbs and PI the same,
    I had just settled down to another video game.

    When out of the fridge there arose such a clatter
    I sprang from the terminal to see what was the matter.
    Away to the cold box, I flew like a flash
    But the stench was o'erpowering and I threw up beef hash.

    The mould on the dampest of walls which were cold
    Had the softness of kittens only seven weeks old;
    When what to my view, a thing I despise
    But a half eaten sandwich and four tiny mice;

    With a little old scientist, so lively and galling,
    I knew at a glance was Linus Pauling.
    More vapid than undergrads, his charges they came,
    And he whistled, and shouted, and called them rude names.

    "Now, Watson! Now Francis! You strange little modellers!
    On Luria! On Bertani! You stupid old broth'lers!
    To the top of the bench, to the top of the wall!
    Purify! Purify! Purify all!"

    As dry heaves before the commitee meeting, bend
    A young student's body and his colon distend,
    So up their earlobes, acytes they grew,
    With a sack full of antibodies, their skin turning blue.

    And then, for a second, I heard from the 'fuge,
    An unbalanced rotor spinning something too huge.
    Where I put down my hand, to better hear the sound,
    Came the snapping of sparks from a wire sans ground.

    Pauling's hair was all wavy, and I thought I must be sick
    `Cause the curl in his hair looked just like a helix.
    On an arm load of oranges, he started to snack
    An I recalled his fetish with citrate, the quack.

    His eyes were all wrinkled, but the cheeks were yet red;
    Not too shabby for a man who was several years dead;
    The leer of his smile was just a tad scary
    And the snow on his rooftop made his head yet quite hairy;

    The end of a pipette, he held in his teeth
    And a pile of kimwipes lay around his big feet.
    He held a small vial of something quite gel-ly,
    A mercaptan no doubt, for it make him quite smelly.

    He changed `round the columns, adding to the confusion
    And I laughed to spite my own paranoid delusion.
    A wink of his eye and a rotation of his head,
    Told me whatever I drank would soon leave me dead.

    He spoke not a word, just buggered up my work,
    And dried all my resins, that silly old jerk.
    And separating his middle finger from first, fourth and third,
    That crazy, old bugger, just flipped me the bird.

    He grabbed up his cohorts and ran down the hall,
    And away they all flew, letting me take the fall.
    That is why, dear Committee, I am sorry to say,
    I need a five year extension, starting today.


    An Xmas present to all from your friends at Aliquotes...happy holidays.

SURVEYING YOUR FUTURE BOOKLET REVISION: GET YOUR ARTICLES IN!!
--------------------------------------------------------------

The committee updating the "Surveying Your Futures" booklet, which
NMNWSE distributes to middle and high school girls to encourage them to
consider a career in science, is working hard to get the new edition
out.  Ann Mauzy (mauzy@lanl.gov, 7-5387), the LAWIS coordinator for
this NMNWSE project, reports that, although we have volunteers for
every topic, some volunteers have not come through yet.

IF YOU HAVE PROMISED TO UPDATE ONE OF THE ARTICLES, AND YOU HAVE NOT
YET DONE IT, YOU'D BETTER HOP ON IT OR A "DESIGNATED NAGGER" WILL BE
AFTER YOU!!!

Seriously, the drop-dead date is Jan 9, and if an author cannot make
that date, PLEASE let Ann know so that the article can be re-assigned.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

EYH KICKOFF MEETING JANUARY 7
-----------------------------

The annual Expanding Your Horizons Conference for 8-10 grade girls in
Northern NM is scheduled for Wednesday, March 25 at the Study Center at
LANL.

Joyce Ann Guzik (joy@lanl.gov, 7-8927) and Alexine Salazar
(alexine@lanl.gov, 7-1785) are co-chairs this year.  The kickoff
meeting is January 7, 11:30-1:00, in the E228 Conference Room in the
Otowi bldg at LANL (beneath the cafeteria).

Please attend the meeting or contact the co-chairs if you are
interested in helping: everything from workshop presenters to fund
raisers to "go-fers" are need. This is a very rewarding experience!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

1997 NMNWSE ANNUAL MEETING AND TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM
--------------------------------------------------

The NMNWSE Annual meeting was held on October 17-19, 1997, at the Vancouver
Suites in Las Cruces.  The first 3 talks in the Technical Symposium were
presented from 4 to 7 pm on Friday evening.  We met at 8:00 the next
morning for the Annual Meeting and then listened to 7 more talks, with a
break for lunch during which we heard Dr. Mary O'Connell speak on
"Bio-Informatics, What is it?"  The afternoon included a tour of the brand
new Farm & Ranch Museum at NMSU (not quite open to the public). The
Symposium Dinner was held at Meson de Mesilla where the dinner speaker was
Donna Eichstaedt who spoke on "The Role Women Played at WSMR."  The
bimonthly Board of Directors meeting was held on Sunday morning and we were
finished before noon.

We heard some excellent talks ranging from "Science Education in New Mexico
in the 21st Century" to "Genetic Diversity of Populations Isolated by
Climate Change."  Two of the speakers from Los Alamos were Angelique Neuman
on "Adhesion Testing of Erbium Oxide Coatings" and Jennifer Roper on "High
Temperature Superconductors: Ion-Beam Assisted Deposition of Biaxially
Aligned Template Films of YSZ for Long Length Coated Conductors."  It was
a very satisfying conference, from my perspective.  We had a good turn-out
and "networked" with women from many fields.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES FROM THE LAWIS LUNCH TALKS
--------------------------------

Tentatively scheduled to speak in January and February at the
LAWIS Lunch-Time Talk Series are Laura Kraemer and Ann Pendergrass.
I'll be sending announcements for their talks as soon as the
dates are set.  I am sure they will be very good talks and
look forward to seeing you all there!

The planned trip in October to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)
near Carlsbad, with a side trip to see Trinity site, unfortunately had
to be cancelled.  We are going to try again on April 3-4 (since Trinity
site is only open 2 days a year - the first Saturday in April and
October).  I am definitely going as that date is my (egad!!) 40th
birthday and somehow is seems fitting to spend it looking at a dump and
where something blew up.... Seriously: we have reports that it is a
pretty good tour, so mark this date on your calendar: I'll begin
arranging the trip about mid-March.  I still have a few copies of the
WIPP brochure Howard Vasquez of the Santa Fe WIPP Information Center
handed out. If anyone is interested in looking at them, let me know and
I'll be happy to stick a copy in the mail.

On September 4, Carol Mooney, at the time GRA representative at
LANL, gave an excellent talk on "Changes and Challenges in Science
Careers".  Carol first got interested in science as a career when she
saw pictures of geologists rafting the Grand Canyon in high school.
(She has yet to do it herself though....) She also did some teaching of
sixth graders while in high school and discovered she loved teaching.
She took a geology major in college.  In those days geology=oil, and
she worked for an oil company for 5 years.  But with the end of the
"windfall profit" days, the job market collapsed.  She saw an
opportunity in making maps (before the days of Computer Aided Design;
CAD), which she did as a private contractor and became quite
successful.  Computer technology rapidly advanced, and she decided to
go back and pursue her love of teaching before CAD made her map making
career obsolete. She got a masters degree in teaching.  She taught for
a while, including high school geology in Los Alamos, and then was
selected for the SERS program and discovered that the life of a teacher
was pretty hard compared to a LANL scientist.  (This program has since
been cancelled as none of it's graduates have returned to teaching as
they all discovered this same truth -- an unfortunate commentary on the
value our society places on arguably the most important profession for
the future of mankind.) She also did an NSF program in Montana where
she "taught teachers" and lead field trips, but found she missed the
mountains so went back to teach at Los Alamos. However, they had hired
a new geology teacher and wanted her to teach biology. Rather than not
use her skills, she took advantage of the opportunity to run the GRA
program program at LANL. Carol emphasized that one should be aware of
other opportunities and not hesitate to take them when they come along,
even if it means a career change.

On October 2, Denise George of T-1 at LANL gave a most enjoyable talk
to LAWIS on "Managing a Software Team".  Denise began her career in
computers as the field was desperate for people, even though she had no
experience in the field.  The emphasis of the time was "codes, codes,
codes". Denise soon realized that she needed a Master's degree if she
was going to be allowed to do anything fun. Things had also changed and
"women were being hired to do interesting things". However, family
intervened so she stayed home for a while, but found this was
not for her.  She then took a job managing a database on cows, where
she learned among other things the role of the "clean-up bull" [I'm
sure you can fill in the details...].  With the birth of ther second
child she again tried her "other career", i.e. "Mom", full time, but
quickly went back to work doing data displays part time ["in the days
before Mac's", Denise emphasized...] In this job she learned about
reactor fuel histories, doing both graphics and support codes. T-2 at
LANL was very cooperative about letting her work part time to take care
of her family. (They hired her when she was 7 months pregnant!) Times
changed again, as they have a way of doing, and Denise found herself
looking for something new.  The CRADA on numerical grid generation was
looking for someone to manage the software team, and Denise was able to
fill the bill. The team is large in the sense of the number of
divisions and interests involved rather than in the the number of
people. Denise has learned that with scientists, one needs to
coordinate more than manage, and that people respond to different
stimuli. If you can get them to "buy in" then everything will go OK,
though some people still require more prodding than others... It is a
diplomatic challenge requiring "more than the carrot but not just the
stick".

Denise's wise words about carrots and sticks remind me:
I am looking for more "volunteers" to speak at LAWIS Lunch-Time Talks
in the Spring. I'll try and avoid leaving a trail back to you
if you send me names of gullible victims ....

COMPUTING MENTORS NEEDED
------------------------

Date: Sat, 13 Dec 1997
From: Celia Einhorn <celia@silicon-desert.com>

Friends,

Betsy Frederick and I are working with NM Technet with the NM High School
Supercomputing Challenge and we need several kinds of mentors.

First:

Is there anyone out there who would be willing to be an online
mentor for Fortran.  What is that some of you young people might ask?  We
already have mentors for UNIX, C++, HTML, JAVA and just hoping that someone
out there would place their email for students in NM would confer with them
about Fortran.  You may not get much business, but we need that angle
covered.  Please email me if you are interested.

Second:

45 Supercomputing Advisors Needed

Welcome to the 8th Annual New Mexico High School Supercomputing
Challenge -- "a program in which student teams and their sponsoring
teachers work on supercomputers to solve scientific problems."

Since the inception of the program in 1990, more than 3,800 New Mexico
high school students and teachers have benefitted from participation.

The Challenge is both a learning experience and a competition. Through
workshops, educational materials, and the help of technical support
resources, students and teachers are exposed to hands-on scientific
problem solving. Teams that make significant progress on their projects
can compete for awards of savings bonds and scholarships for
individuals, computer equipment for the schools, and trophies for teams.

This year, the executive committee is focusing on getting each team an
advisor.  Please check out the role of advisor at
http://www.technet.nm.org/challenge/challenge_details.html#roleadvisor

Check out the teams' abstracts at
http://mode.lanl.k12.nm.us/97.98/abstracts   Find the ones who still need
an advisor and if that is in your area, please volunteer. Please contact
the teacher through email or phone and find out how you can help.  The
executive committe believes that your input will help more teams complete
their work.

Our regional meetings are coming up in January.  We need people to join
us at the Meet the Scientist Luncheons to help our teams with project
design.  The regionals are as follows:

 - Tuesday, January 13, Eastern, Portales
 - Thursday, January 15,  NMSU, Cruces
 - Friday, January 16, Tech, Socorro
 - Monday, January 26, San Juan, Farmington
 - Wednesday, January 28, UNM, Alb.
 - Friday, January 30, Highlands, Las Vegas

Please contact consult@mode.lanl.k12.nm.us, if you have any questions,
to let us know what teams are covered and which regional session you can
attend for lunch.

When you volunteer your time, please register as an advisor for the
Challenge at
http://www.technet.nm.net/cgi-bin/noauth/prod/chal97/req_rec.cgi/advisor

Thanking you,
Betsy and Celia

SCHOLARSHIP/EDUCATION RESOURCES
-------------------------------

You may recall some months ago I forwarded a request for information
about veterinary scholarships in NM. Summarized below are the responses,
should this question come up for any of you in the future.
I would like to thank all those who gave suggestions.

-- Tinka

Suggested Resources:

1) The WICHE (Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education)
student exchange program at UNM  Chris and Julie discuss in the next
article was suggested, which is how I found out about the problems they
have encountered there. (I urge you to consider writing your
representative to express your opinion on this matter after reading
their letter.) The WICHE program allows students interested in programs
not offered at UNM to go to schools offering that program in the
western region covered, and pay the same tuition. They also have
scholarships available.  Under the current guidelines, if you have a NM
high-school diploma, and are interested in a program not offered at
UNM, this may be worth pursuing.

2) UNM-LA's Career
Resource Center has a software program called Choices.  This program
provides current information on scholarships available from a number of
sources in the US.  There are two books in the reference section of the
UNM-LA library.  The first one is called the "Occupational Outlook
Handbook,"  Call# REF HD5706.022 1996-97.  This book provides info. on
the occupation and related data.  The second is "The College Blue Book,"
Call # REF L901 .C685 V5.  This one gives about six scholarships awarded
for this educational pursuit.  Feel free to make an appointment for
additional help at the Career Resource Center located in Building 2 on
the UNM-LA campus.  Phone# 662-5919, ext. 202. --

3) The career counseling center at the High School.
(I do not know what the restrictions on access are for non-students.)

4) The Sante Fe AAUW sponsors a small scholarship for graduate studies at UNM.
To find out more about it
the best place to start would probably be the UNM Grad School office.
If it is of interest to you and you have trouble finding out about
it, Nancy Scheer, nscheer@lanl.gov, is willing to help you track this down
(it is not listed on the AAUW web page).

5) Internet: various people suggested the following web sites.
Of course, some may have a "nominal" fee, some have one free search.

Scholarships for Women and Minorities:
	http://members.aol.com/ox13qr/webpages/eyfswm1.html
Yahoo! Scholarship Programs:
	http://www.yahoo.com/Education/Financial_Aid/Scholarship_Programs/
http://www2.nas.edu/cpc/index.html
http://www.hr.lanl.gov/html/specprog/bulletinboard/
  (there are 2 scholarship programs on the LANL student bulletin board)

I'm sure there a lots more.  One sure bet is to contact Veterinary Colleges
(or the appropriate department for other interests), and get a list from them.

6) For people already in school, it was suggested that the financial aid
office of the university would probably be the best place to start.

7) Student loans are somewhat easier to obtain than scholarships,
and might be worth considering as an alternative for people who
have not already considered this option.

REQUEST FOR ACTION: JANUARY LOBBY FOR WICHE ACCESS CHANGE
---------------------------------------------------------

Date: Mon, 8 Dec 1997
From: "Christopher J. Fontes" <cjf@xdiv.lanl.gov>

It's been a couple of months since I first contacted you about the WICHE
(Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education) student exchange program
situation. We know enough now about the situation that Julie and I are
lobbying the state legislature for the upcoming session in January.
The folks from the WICHE office are also lobbying for a change too.
So now I'm asking you to send out a call to all interested parties
who are interested in joining the lobby effort.

We all feel that the requirement of having a NM high school diploma to
be eligible for the WICHE program is too restrictive and unfairly
excludes residents/tax payers who might otherwise be qualified for
the program. This requirement will undermine the quality of the program
in the future. We have been told by WICHE personnel that the provision of
requiring a NM high school diploma was a knee-jerk response to allegations that
people are moving to NM from out-of state in order to take advantage
of the WICHE program. We have been able to find no documents that support
this allegation. In addition the same legislation officially change
WICHE from a grant program to a fee-for-service program, which requires
enrollees to work exclusively in NM for so many years after receipt of degree.

We are lobbying the legislature to eliminate the requirement of a NM high
school diploma. The WICHE folks think the legislature will do this provided
they instead require NM residency for a certain number of years (anywhere
from 3-5 years is what we have heard). We feel that a requirement
of state residency will allow for the consideration of those residents who have
moved to NM after receiving a high school diploma from a different state.

I am not wild about the fee-for-service stipulations listed above (there are
indications that this option will allow for the exploitation of newly minted
graduates in certain fields). But it appears that the legislature is under
pressure to get something in return for their offering of educational support.
Additionally, the fee-for-service option should discourage people from
wanting to move to NM, assuming that is what's really happening, just to get
into the WICHE program and then go on their merry way after receiving their
education.

If you could send this missive to the WIS distribution and ask for interested
parties, it would be much appreciated. Below is a letter that Julie has sent to
Governor Johnson and various state reps and senators. From the letter you
can see that the legislation which enacted the requirement of a NM high school
diploma was an amendment to Senate Bill 1115. The addresses of the governor and
the representative/senator for Los Alamos are also given:

Thanks,

 --- (letter from Julie to Governor Johnson follows) ---

Dear Governor Johnson:

I am writing to tell you how a recent amendment of the WICHE (Western
Interstate Commission on Higher Education) student exchange program,
requiring participants to have a NM high school diploma, has affected
my life.  And I am asking you to change the law in the upcoming
legislative session.

I am a twenty-nine year old physical therapist who moved to NM in
1995.  My one dream in life has been to become a veterinarian.  Having
finally reached a point in life where I could follow that dream, I
began making inquiries in early 1997.  I contacted several schools and
veterinarians and they suggested I look into the WICHE program (then
run by UNM).  In case you are not familiar with this program, it allows
certified students to attend certain out-of-state schools, which have
programs not offered by any NM school, for in-state tuition.

The NM WICHE employee I spoke with in March of 1997 indicated that
since I had resided in the state for two years and held a current
driver's license, car registration and bank account I would be able to
participate in the program.  He stated that I needed to wait for
applications to be printed, and suggested I call back in early May to
request my application.

I was overjoyed.  I was confident I would be accepted into vet school,
having an excellent academic background (a 4.0 GPA Master's degree in
Physical Therapy and a 3.75 GPA Bachelor's degree in Biology).  I
reduced my working hours as a therapist and began volunteering at The
Wildlife Center in Espanola with Kathleen Ramsay, DVM, to get the
veterinary experience I needed for my vet school application.

I called the NM WICHE program again in May, and was told they were in
transition.  Worried that the program was changing, I spoke again with
several employees and they assured me that all was well and that they
were just restructuring and relocating to Santa Fe.  I was told to call
back in July for my application.

Reassured, I made plans to leave my job and began full-time
preveterinary work at The Wildlife Center.  When I called WICHE back in
July and was told applications were not yet ready, I was not too
nervous.  I again questioned the employee with whom I spoke and was
told that funding was solid and that "vet-med" students were a
priority.

Not until I called back in August did I learn of my dismal prospects.
I spoke with Lillian Montoya-Real and was told for the first time that
an amendment to Senate Bill #1115C had changed the program and that now
a NM high school diploma was a requirement for participation.
Essentially, I was told that there was no way I could be funded as an
in-state student at any university.  This forces me to leave the state
to be able to afford vet school--just because I do not possess a NM
high school diploma (and despite the fact that I am a tax-paying
resident who is in every other way extremely qualified).  What angers
me so much is that I have lost a year.  I now have to move and
establish residency in a state with a vet school and reapply (and pay
for that new application) for 1999.  If I had been told earlier of the
amendment, I could have established residency in another state and
entered school in 1998.  By not informing me of the changes in rules
until late August the people of the NM WICHE program did me a great
disservice. I think what upsets me most, though, is that I am being
forced out of the state--out of my home--if I want to follow my dream.

The people I have spoken with at WICHE since July have been much more
helpful.  Lillian and Ken have been very honest and encouraging.  They
have both informed me that they disagree with the "diploma amendment"
and feel that since this is now a "loan-for-four years of service" that
the clause is redundant.  They have assured me that they will lobby the
state legislature to eliminate the amendment, and I promised to do my
part by informing you of how this has affected me.

I ask you again to please change the law.  I agree wholeheartedly with
the four years of service as partial repayment of New Mexico's
generosity.  I would gladly serve longer--and hope to spend the rest of
my life and career here.  I also agree that the program should only be
open to residents who show that they are "here to stay".  But to
require a NM high school diploma excludes many qualified residents who
should be allowed to compete to participate in this program.  To
exclude us is unfair and will not allow some of the most qualified
people to receive funding and become NM veterinarians.  This will hurt
NM in the long run--by diminishing the quality of services provided.
Please do not allow this to happen.  It is within your power to make
things right.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

As many of you may be aware, all references to evolution were deleted
from the New Mexico State Board of Education Science Content Standards
with Benchmarks for grades kindergarten through 12.  The Coalition for
Excellence in Science Education
(http://www.highfiber.com/~dfbeck/CESE/CESEhome/html),
which is chartered to improve science education and science literacy,
has been actively concerned with addressing this deletion. If this
topic is of concern to you, please check out their web page for
membership information.

The Committee on the Status of Women in Physics of the American
Physical Society maintains a Colloquium/Seminar Speakers List of Women
in Physics, and a Colloquium Speakers List of Minorities in Physics.
Both lists will be mailed to all physics departments this fall along
with information on the APS Travel Grants Program which helps
institutions invite speakers from these lists.  If you are interested in
registering on these lists, or browsing them to look for potential
speakers to invite, see the web site at
