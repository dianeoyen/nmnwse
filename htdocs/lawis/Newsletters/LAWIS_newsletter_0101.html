<p><A NAME="11_15"></A><b>MEETING MINUTES: NOVEMBER 15, 2000</b><br>
The last Steering Committee Meeting was conducted at the LAWIS party on the 15th of December. 
I haven't gotten those minutes yet, but here is the DRAFT version of the minutes from the 
November meeting.<br><br>
<b>ATTENDANCE</b><br>
The steering committee for Los Alamos Women in Science met Wed.,
November 15, 2000 at 1:00 in Otowi Cafeteria.  Members present were Cathy 
Cleland, Lisa Coletti, Laura McNamara, Lori Merrill, Kristina Moreno, Kathy 
Prestridge, Dana Roberson, Tinka Gammel.  Kristina Moreno served as secretary in absence 
of Ann Mauzy. <br><br>
<b>APPROVAL OF MINUTES</b><br>
Minutes of the October 18, 2000 meeting were approved as amended:  note Lori Merrill's 
spelling of her last name. EYH. As to date, there have been 2,000 career books ordered. 
Alexine and Dana will look into ordering more bags as whether or not the state will 
pay for these as "giveaways".  Dana will contact the state board.  In addition, Mabel 
Vigil-Gray has been named co-chair.  Lisa Coletti volunteered to work on redoing the 
registration forms. Kristina Moreno volunteered to work the Help Desk.<br><br>

<b>TREASURER</b><br>
Since Susana Delano is no longer the official treasurer, she 
cannot sign the signature card; Janie will have to do this.  The books still need to 
be audited before handing them off; Lisa, Janie, and Susana will audit books.  Kristina will 
contact Janie and Susana about getting the books to her once audit has taken place.
<br><br>
<b>HONORARY MEMBERSHIP</b><br>
Motion to continue honorary membership to Colleen
Olinger (Otowi Bookstore) and Kathleen Ramsey (Cottonwood Vet.) was passed.<br><br>

<b>SCIENCE FAIRS</b><br>
Motion was passed to support the science fairs in Los 
Alamos, Las Vegas, Pojoaque, and Espanola for a total of $250.00.  Lori Merrill will 
serve as volunteer for the Espanola science fair, Cathy will help judge.  Pojoaque 
already has a volunteer.  Information about the science fairs can be located on the web 
site.<br><br>

<b>DONATIONS</b><br>Honeywell has donated to EYH for an unknown amount.<br><br>

<b>NETWORKING</b><br>
Cathy spoke with HR about a job announcement networking system.
They suggested we do a bulk e-mail list to announce to check the job page 
for official jobs once a week.  This will be a separate email list from the LAWIS 
list. Cathy will work on listserver to start this with help from Tinka.  Additional info 
will be linked on the LAWIS website about job networking.<br><br>

<b>MENTORING</b><br>At the state board meeting, an announcement was made about the
Professional Development Seminar. It will be held in June 2001 in 
Albuquerque.  It will be a day long event which will include seminars on resume writing.<br>
<font color=red><b>FILL OUT THOSE SURVEYS!!</b></font>
<br><br>

<b>BYLAWS</b><br>
Revisions finally passed!!!  The count was at 27 "Yes" which is the
majority.  A motion was moved and passes to accept the bylaws as revised.<br><br>

<p><a name="mentor"></a><b>MENTORING INSIGHTS FROM JANIE ENTER</b>
<p>Mentoring has become Janie Enter's post-LAWIS-presidential project.  
She is interested in opening a dialogue among
LAWIS members about mentoring, its importance, and fostering mentoring 
relationships. This month, she sent in a brief column about mentoring.  Let it inspire 
you, then get in touch with Janie about her efforts to leverage LAWIS's involvement in 
mentoring.  Janie writes:<br><br>
<b>MENTORING OVERVIEW…</b>. [adapted from Zachary, L. (2000). The Mentor's Guide. 
Jossey-Bass, San Francisco]. <br>
Today's mentors are more than just people who help others
find a jewel of wisdom or a promotion at work.  Mentors "impart lessons in 
the art of living." (Zalman Schachter-Shalomi).  They extend the human activity of 
care beyond the grounds of family.  At their best they inspire others to reach beyond 
themselves, showing others how to make a positive difference in a broader world, and see 
others in ways they have been seen before.<br>
Traditional mentoring has been one of an authoritarian teacher/dependent 
student, in which the mentee sits at the feet of the master and receives 
knowledge.  Modern mentoring casts the mentor more as a facilitator in the learning process 
by creating a climate conducive to learning.  Rather than being mentor driven, with the 
mentor taking full responsibility for the mentee's learning, the mentee learns to share 
responsibility for the learning setting, priorities, learning, and becomes increasingly 
self-directed.  If the learner is not ready to assume a degree of responsibility, the mentor 
nurtures and develops the mentee's capacity for self-direction.  As the learning 
relationship evolves, both the mentor and mentee share the accountability and responsibility for 
achieving a mentee's learning goals.<br>
This shift in mentoring practices follows new information about adult learning
(Knowles):
<ul type=square>
  <li>Adults tend to learn best when they are involved in diagnosing, 
planning, implementing, and evaluating their own learning
  <li>The role of the facilitator is one that creates and maintains a 
supportive climate promoting conditions necessary for learning to take place
  <li>Adult learners have a desire to be self directing
  <li>Readiness for learning increases when there is a specific drive to know
  <li>Life's reservoir is a primary learning resource; the life experiences of 
others enrich the learning process for both the mentor and mentee
  <li>Adult learners have an inherent desire for immediacy of application
  <li>Learning in adults is best when they are internally motivated 
</ul><br>
Next month, Janie will discuss what she's learned about facilitating 
learning in a mentoring relationship.  For more information, you can contact Janie via 
e-mail: <a href="mailto:volcano@lanl.gov">volcano@lanl.gov</a>.

<h2><A name=announce></a>ANNOUNCEMENTS, EVENTS, ETC.</h2>
<p>
<ol>
   <li><b><font color=red><a name="teach"></a>URGENT!!!  CALLING ALL CHEMISTRY TEACHERS</font></b><br>
The New Mexico Academy for Sciences and Mathematics, an independent college preparatory 
school located in Santa Fe, is seeking a part-time Chemistry teacher who will 
teach Introduction to Chemistry to 10th graders from 8:20 - 9:30 am Monday through Friday, 
starting January 8th.  Contact Molly Multedo at 954-4000, or e-mail her at the Academy: 
<a href="mailto:mmultedo@newmexacad.org">mmultedo@newmexacad.org</a>.

   <li><b><font color=red><a name=scifair></a>IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR… NO, NOT CHRISTMAS…. IT'S SCIENCE
FAIR SEASON!</font></b><br>
<b>The Los Alamos County Science Fair will be held on February 2-3</b>, 
2001. LAWIS will once again be giving out awards <font color=blue>"to promote gender equity 
and to encourage female students to continue their studies in math and science." </font>
We will need volunteers to help with the judging (Friday evening, Saturday 
morning).  Tinka will send a "call for judges" out in mid-January so no reply is needed at this time, 
but if you are interested in helping please reserve the February date on your calendar 
and let Tinka know that you want to judge.  It's FUN!  <br>
<b>And more Science Fair News…</b> we're 
extending our reach…  In addition to the Los Alamos County Science Fair, 
last year we gave out awards at the <b>Taos and Pojoaque Science Fairs</b>, and the <b>Las Vegas 
Regional Science Fair</b> (where we were a  "silver donor"). The LAWIS board is considering 
whether to continue or expand this activity  actually, that's a bit 
misleading, because the idea has a lot of support from the LAWIS board members.  It's more a 
matter of which schools and how much award money we can afford, and how to portion our 
funds to get the most out of them. The philosophy seems to be "more-smaller-awards."  
If you would like to see LAWIS present awards at other area Science Fairs, please 
contact Tinka (<a href="mailto:jtg@lanl.gov">jtg@lanl.gov</a>) or Cathy Cleland (
<a href="mailto:buzzer@lanl.gov">buzzer@lanl.gov</a>) with your suggestions. 
We will also need volunteers now to contact the science fair coordinator at these 
schools to find out the dates and let them know we will be giving awards, and later to 
organize the judging for the LAWIS awards at these locations. The LAWIS board will meet to 
discuss award amounts and which fairs to participate on 11/15 1-2 PM, at one of the 
tables in the back part of Otowi Cafeteria at LANL (this is an open area and non-LANL people 
can come; map locating the cafeteria can be <a href="http://nis-www.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/wthi?ta=3&bldg=261" 
target=_blank>
viewed here</a>). Please attend the meeting, or email <a href="mailto:jtg@lanl.gov">Tinka</a> or LAWIS 
President <a href"mailto:buzzer@lanl.gov">Cathy Cleland</a>, if you wish to give input on the 
LAWIS awards at either the Los Alamos County or other northern New Mexico Science Fairs.

awards:  <a href="http://home.lanl.gov/lawis/ScienceFair" target=_blank>home.lanl.gov/lawis/ScienceFair</a>.<br>
 
<b>We have new Science Fair 
Award Certificates…</b><br> Well, guess LAWIS is moving out of the Cretaceous… that's 
right, no more dinosaur award certificates.  Instead, Jody Shepard of T-DO has made 
some really elegant and inspiring certificates for the LAWIS science fair award program, 
watermarked with photos of famous women who have forged successful careers in 
science. Very apropos of our mission, I think…. If you want to see the 
certificate, contact any of the board members and we'll e-mail you a copy. <font color=green><b>
Thanks to Jody for 
her great graphic expertise</b></font>.

<h2><A name=eyh></a>EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS</h2><br>
<p>It's that EYH time of year too… Expanding
Your Horizons is coming up fast and even though Dana Roberson hasn't said 
anything to me, I'm sure she and her crew would appreciate any help she can get with 
organizing this year's event.  There are plenty of projects  student recruitment, 
registration packets, help desk, getting funding, publicity, and many more…<br>
<br>If you're interested, </b>
you may contact Dana at <a href="mailto:dsroberson@lanl.gov">dsroberson@lanl.gov</a>. 
I speak from experience when I say that working with
Dana is a joy, because she's super-organized and stays on top of everything…
</p>

<h2><A name=misc></a>MISCELLANEOUS</h2><br>
<p><b>Getting the LAWIS word out…</b><br>
The LAWIS board has put together a recruitment brochure to bring new members into the 
organization.  Wanda Roybal in HR-5 Staffing has kindly offered to include it in all the new 
hire packets. We're also looking into making table cards for Otowi, and possibly putting 
copies around town   Mesa Public Library and UNM-Los Alamosa are two potential 
sites.  If you've got any ideas about appropriate places to display our brochure, including 
people to contact about displaying it, call or e-mail Laura McNamara (665-9685, e-mail
<a href="mailto:lauramc@lanl.gov">lauramc@lanl.gov</a>) or Lori Merrill (<a href="mailto:lori@telomere.lanl.gov">
lori@telomere.lanl.gov</a>) and we'll do 
what we can to get it out there.  And speaking of getting the word out: if you know a 
young Marie Curie…  steer her to the American Women in Science Website for information 
on their scholarship program for undergraduate and graduate science students:<br>

<h2><a name=comserv></a>COMMUNITY SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
<p>Looking for some scientifically validated fun? <b>Volunteer for Science Fun 
Night.</b><br>
<b>Chamisa Elementary School</b> in White Rock is planning a Science Fun Night 
from 5:30 until 7 pm on Thursday, January 18, 2001.  The idea is to have adult 
volunteers man stations with short, simple, fun hands-on science projects that kids can 
watch and do along the lines of the Bradbury's High-Tech Halloween.  Chamisa is looking for
volunteers (in this town, that should be no problem)  if you've got an 
idea for a cool project or demonstration that would be appropriate for K-6th graders 
and/or if you would be willing to help out, call Deb Summa at 665-1854 or 672-1953.
