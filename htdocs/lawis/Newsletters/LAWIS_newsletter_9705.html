<P>ACTING ACTING PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE

<P>---------------------------------

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Carol LaDelfe is on travel through the end of the month and used
her

<P>executive powers to appoint me temporary president.  Please feel
free

<P>to contact me if there is anything I can help with this month.  So
far,

<P>my only official act has been to agree NOT to schedule our summer
picnic

<P>to conflict with the LANL student summer picnic. Which reminds me,

<P>any volunteers to help plan the LAWIS picnic??

<P>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>LAWIS LUNCHES

<P>-------------

<P>&nbsp;

<P>The LAWIS Lunch-Time Talks Series is well on it's way to becoming
a

<P>venerable tradition (at least, I hope!).  Since the last
newsletter,

<P>Mary Stinecipher Campbell of DX-2 at LANL gave a talk and
demonstration

<P>on "Positive Uses of High Explosives".  This was quite
informative,

<P>explaining the different between conflagration, deflagration, and

<P>detonation, and the demonstration (also presented to the girls who

<P>participated in her workshop at EYH) was a lot of fun with a bit
of a

<P>surprise at the end.  I have a copy of Mary's handout on the story
of

<P>dynamite which I can give to interested people, and she was
willing to

<P>give a repeat should there be sufficient interest at a later date.
The

<P>audience at this talk proved LAWIS is a non-discriminatory
organization

<P>(it was approximately 20% male). Unfortunately it was also clear
that

<P>LAWIS is not a very radical organization or more of us would have
been

<P>there to hone our explosives skills...

<P>&nbsp;

<P>The talk by Janie Enter of CST-7 at LANL on her "Checkerboard
Career"

<P>was much better attended -- of course, we did offer free pizza

<P>and were handing out appreciation gifts to those who helped with
EYH --

<P>and had a very lively discussion following. Janie has had
experience

<P>with many different job situations, and is a good resource for
those

<P>who might need to talk with someone when their career path
deviates

<P>from the straightforward.  Pointers from Janie Enter's talk:

<P>&nbsp;

<P>1) Survival Tips:

<P>  - believe in yourself

<P>  - network, network, network

<P>  - don't get sick

<P>  - may be a good idea to hide your best work

<P>  - participate in Laboratory activities

<P>  - be persistent but polite

<P>  - play dumb if you have to ("listen to Janis Joplin" later)

<P>  - support the administrative assistants

<P>&nbsp;

<P>2) Useful LANL Organizations

<P>  - EAC

<P>  - SEAC

<P>  - DVO

<P>  - Special Interest Topics

<P>  - DOE Review of Laboratory Programs for Women

<P>  - LAWIS

<P>&nbsp;

<P>3) Useful External Organizations

<P>  - League of Women Voters

<P>  - National Association for Women in Education

<P>  - American Association of University Women

<P>&nbsp;

<P>4) Don't give up

<P>  - even when the turkeys try to keep you down!

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Two books by Sheila Tobias were recommended in the ensuing
discussion:

<P> -- They're Not Dumb, They're Different: Stalking the Second Tier

<P> -- Rethinking Science As A Career

<P>The publisher is "Research Corporation". Let me (Tinka, 7-9149,

<P>jtg@lanl.gov) know if you would like to see LAWIS get a copy of
these

<P>books for our "reference library" (which currently consists of a
few

<P>articles and some videos on gender-bias in science and the like --

<P>contact me if you would like to see the "library"), or if you need
help

<P>locating a copy for your own perusal.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>The next LAWIS Lunch-Time Talk is scheduled for 12:00 noon Tuesday
May 20.

<P>Michelle Thomsen of NIS 1 at LANL has agreed to talk on "Space
Weather",

<P>which promises to be another very interesting talk. Hope to see
you there!

<P>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>AAUW PAY EQUITY SURVEY

<P>----------------------

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Following on the discussion after Janie's talk mentioned

<P>in the previous article, Denise George thought people might

<P>be interested in this:

<P>&nbsp;

<P>FAIRNESS IN COMPETITION GAME -- ANSWERS

<P>AAUW survey from approximately 1990

<P>&nbsp;

<P>1. In survey after survey, what issue is in the top three for

<P>   working people? &#91;PAY EQUITY&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>2) What is the ratio of women's pay to men's pay in the US? 
&#91;71%&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>3) What is the ratio for hispanic women? &#91;53%&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>4) What is it in NM? &#91;67% PER 1990 CENSUS&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>5) What AAUW branch was the first to start a pay equity

<P>   project?  &#91;D.C.&#93; When? &#91;1913&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>6) What is the significance of April 11? &#91;PAY EQUITY DAY,

<P>   WHEN FEMALE SALARIES CATCH UP TO MALES&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>7) Why isn't the Equal Pay Act enough? &#91;IT HAS HELPED,

<P>   BUT 33 YRS LATER THERE IS STILL A SUBSTANTIAL WAGE GAP.

<P>   FEMALE WORK IS UNDERVALUED.&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>8) Some conservatives (e.g., Suzanne Fields) say wage

<P>   inequities are largely solved. What statistic do they use

<P>   and what are they distorting? &#91;WOMEN AGES 27-33 WITHOUT

<P>   CHILDREN ARE EQUAL. APPLES AND ORANGES COMPARISON OF WOMEN

<P>   WITHOUT CHILDREN TO MEN WITH/WITHOUT.  ALSO, AS WOMEN MATURE,

<P>   WAGE GAP WIDENS. OVERALL IT's A 71% WAGE GAP.&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>9) Please order these groups according to median wages (1=top)

<P>   __ White Men

<P>   __ Hispanic Men

<P>   __ Black Men

<P>   __ White Women

<P>   __ Hispanic Women

<P>   __ Black Women

<P>   &#91;ANS: SAME AS ORDER LISTED&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>10) Which ethnic/racial/gender group has the highest labor

<P>    participation rate in NM and the second highest in the U.S.?

<P>    &#91;AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>11) What is the wage gap between men and women in these jobs?

<P>    Managers? &#91;32%&#93; Secretaries? &#91;10%&#93; College
Professors? &#91;22%&#93;

<P>    Elementary School Teachers? &#91;12%&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>12) What happens to wages when men begin to dominate a job?

<P>    &#91;WAGES GO UP&#93; What happens to wages when females begin
to

<P>    dominate a job? &#91;WAGES GO DOWN&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>13) T/F: The wage gap between men and women can be attributed

<P>    to men having more education, experience, and time on the job.

<P>    &#91;NOT TRUE. THIS IS A MYTH! MANY STUDIES, E.G. NATIONAL
ACADEMY

<P>    OF SCIENCE, AMERICAN COMPENSATION ASSOCIATION, HAVE SHOWN
THESE

<P>    LEGITIMATE FACTORS ACCOUNT FOR ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THE WAGE
GAP.&#93;

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Denise also had a very amusing article on why women should pay

<P>lower income taxes (we don't commit as many crimes so we burden

<P>society less). Maybe I'll include it if there is an April 15 

<P>Issue next year...

<P>&nbsp;

<P>STANDARDS FOR THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN NM SCHOOLS

<P>---------------------------------------------------

<P>&nbsp;

<P>In light of recent election results and that the NM State Science

<P>Standards and Benchmarks are once again being revised, especially

<P>as concerns the teaching of "a science based theory of human
origin",

<P>people might be interested in the following list of important
state

<P>science and education/teacher organizations.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>I think all of us consider the erosion of academic standards

<P>in the schools is a travesty. It has been proposed that LAWIS

<P>form a working group to inform themselves and recommend

<P>possible action on this important issue. If you would like to

<P>be a part of this working group, please let me (Tinka, 7-9149,

<P>jtg@lanl.gov) know.

<P>1997 EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS

<P>-----------------------------------

<P>&nbsp;

<P>We had a very successful Expanding Your Horizons program March 20,
1997.

<P>Nearly 120 8th-10th grade girls and 25 teachers/adults
participated from

<P>many schools in Northern New Mexico.  We almost filled the study
center to

<P>its 150 person capacity.  John Webster gave us some great
pre-conference

<P>publicity with his article and interviews in the March issue of

<P>Reflections.  The program included a team-building activity, in
which the

<P>girls used straws and paper to construct an egg-protection device
that

<P>allowed their raw egg to be dropped from increasing heights
without

<P>breaking; morning and afternoon hands-on scientific workshops; a
cookout

<P>lunch at Otowi patio; and guest presentations by Dr. Barbara Stine
and Dr.

<P>Diane Albert of Los Alamos.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>From my perspective as a co-coordinator, the most important
highlight was

<P>the star volunteers.  I don't have space here to acknowledge
everyone, but

<P>sponsoring EYH is a big enterprise; as a measure, Deborah Kubicek
purchased

<P>over 60 mugs as appreciation gifts for EYH volunteers.  Wendee
Brunish and

<P>Karen Schultz-Paige recruited presenters and "gofers" and arranged

<P>logistics for 15 hands-on workshops given in the morning and
afternoon.

<P>They added several workshops at the last minute as the
registration

<P>steadily grew beyond our expectations.  Diane Albert raised an
incredible

<P>amount of funding from lab and outside sponsors (over $7000).  In
addition,

<P>when we needed an afternoon guest speaker, Diane came to the
rescue and

<P>presented a very interesting talk on her research in high-tech
materials.

<P>Judy Kares and Santa Fe AAUW members visited Santa Fe schools and
recruited

<P>a sizable percentage of our participants, in addition to helping
out on

<P>the day of the conference.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>We had excellent reports from the adults on the workshops
presented by

<P>Garry Franklin at the Science Museum, and Bill Powell and friends
of the

<P>American Vacuum Society on classroom science demonstrations and
activities.

<P>Carol LaDelfe, Ann Mauzy did their usual efficient job with
registration.

<P>Tinka Gammel, Margo Clark, Denise George, Sandy Fletcher, Pat
Berger, and

<P>Trish Wright helped out with numerous behind-the-scenes
arrangements.

<P>Deborah Kubicek and Ginger Young orchestrated the popular egg-drop
team

<P>activity.  Shirley Herrera acted as co-coordinator, and helped to
see that

<P>less slipped through the cracks as well as organizing the great
cookout

<P>lunch and reserving facilities.  We also greatly appreciate the
help of

<P>PA-4, the conference and visit management group, particularly
Patsy

<P>Martinez for running a professional conference.  Also we thank
Patty

<P>Mahoney for finishing the ES&amp;H approval for the workshops on
short notice.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>We are hoping with the experience and financial foundation of this
year to

<P>make next year's EYH even more successful.  I know from the
evaluations,

<P>letters and calls I've received that you have made a difference in

<P>encouraging young women to consider the option of a career in
science.  I

<P>hope you will help us again next year (tentative date Thursday
March 12,

<P>1998) with your diverse talents.

<P>LAWIS AT BRING YOUR KIDS TO WORK DAY

<P>------------------------------------

<P>&nbsp;

<P>For "Bring Your Kids To Work Day" at LANL, myself (Tinka Gammel),

<P>Denise George, and Nely Padial staffed two LAWIS demonstrations

<P>in the Otowi cafeteria siderooms during the lunch hours.

<P>the first was "Mathematics of Games".  We brought in several games

<P>with topological, combinatoric, and other math themes (e.g., a

<P>Rubrix cube). We let the kids play while trying to point out

<P>the mathematical principles. The second was "Magnets". I brought

<P>my box of magnets and iron filings gleaned from a local arroyo

<P>and tried to demonstrate action at a distance and making invisible

<P>things visible, but mostly leaned all sorts of new games one

<P>can play with big magnets. At any rate the kids had a lot of fun,

<P>hopefully saw not all science is boring, and maybe even

<P>learned a thing or two.
