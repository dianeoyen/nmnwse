"Phynish" Web site is one we might use as a model.<br><br>
<b>OLD BUSINESS</b><br>
<u>Report From NMNWSE</u>: Angelique reported that the Annual Meeting has only 
two papers and 14 signed up to attend. We discussed the appropriateness of 
using the student e-mail alias sa-all@lanl.gov to get the word out.
Fema Claim: Tinka will claim "miscellaneous" losses from FEMA. She 
reported that she had given tapes and pictures to the Science Museum 
before the fire. Ann reported that we are just waiting on a copy of our

<p><a name="10_18"></a><b>MEETING MINUTES: OCTOBER 18, 2000</b>
<p>At press time, the minutes from the October 18th meeting had not yet been 
revised or approved. I'm including it to give some idea of our 
discussions, but please keep in mind that this is a draft version.</p>

<b>ATTENDANCE</b>
The steering committee for Los Alamos Women in Science met Wed., Oct. 18, 
at 1:00 p.m. in Side Room C of the Otowi cafeteria. Members present were 
Cathy Cleland, Lisa Colletti, Ann Mauzy, Laura McNamara, Lori Merrill, 
Kristina Moreno, Kathy Prestridge, and Dana Roberson. Janie Enter was 
absent. Alexine Salazar, Anne Fitzpatrick, Mary Campbell, Margo Clark, and 
Susana Delano also attended.<br><br>

<b>APPROVAL OF MINUTES</b>
Minutes of the October 5th meeting were approved as amended: remove 
Dolores Monta&#241;o from the list of board members.<br><br>

<h3>OLD BUSINESS:</h3>
<b>BYLAWS REVISIONS</b>
There was no response on the first e-mail notice with an attachment. A few 
voted at the annual LAWIS meeting. Ann will send out hard copies with a 
return deadline of Nov. 1. Mary noted that the revisions do not need a 2/3 
majority. A simple majority will suffice.<br><br>
<b>FEMA CLAIM</b>
Update: A check for the full amount was received Thursday, Oct 19. Alexine 
took it to the Annual NMNWSE meeting.<br><br>
<b>EYH CO-CHAIR</b>
The date for the 2001 EYH is March 28. We are already getting requests 
from teachers. Dana reported that she had contacted the "Physics 
Chanteuse." She feels the co-chair should be a LANL person. who will be 
the Chair for 2002. Alexine and Dana will work on this and try to get 
someone from last year's committee. If not, we will recruit from the 
membership at large through the newsletter.<br><br>
<b>RECRUITMENT BROCHURE AND MORE</b>
Laura is back on the recruitment brochure intended for the New-Hire 
packet. The person to contact is Barbara Pacheco. We suggested that the 
Membership Committee contact the UNM Science Department, send the 
brochures to master management, other colleges, the library, each 
division, and the Bradbury Science Museum. The committee could also put 
out put table cards at the cafeteria. Dana said she could print the 
brochure and would send it to contractors and the DOE.<br><br>
<b>TREASURER HAND-OFF</b>
The past and present treasurer will get together for the hand-off of the 
books. The April 2000 statement is missing. A motion passed to authorize 
Susana to spend the $3 to get a copy. Lisa Colletti will be an auditor, 
and Kristina will ask Janey to be another auditor. New signature cards 
will include Janey, Kristina, and Cathy.<br><br>
<b>OUTREACH CHAIR</b>
Membership chair Lori Merrill will also serve as Outreach Chair if she has 
sufficient help. The Outreach Committee will include EYH and new 
memberships under their umbrella.<br><br>
<b>LAWIS WEB PAGE</b>
Update the Web page and change it to show the Steering Committee's new 
meeting schedule (see <a href="http://home.lanl.gov/LAWIS/BoardMeetingSched.html" target=_blank>
NEXT MEETING</a>).<br><br>
<b>MENTORING</b>
Other organizations that have mentoring include WGWD, HR-6, and student 
mentors. We agreed what we need are networks. We talked about getting HR 
generalists involved. We need to have something unique, coherent, and 
effective.<br>
It was suggested that we get HR to come and talk to us about what they are 
doing to publicize jobs to women and to encourage them to apply. Laura 
will get someone from HR 6 to do a   lunchtime talk. Cathy will talk to HR 
generalist in her organization about how to work through the HR generalists.<br><br>
<b>NEW BUSINESS:</b><br>
<u>Child care</u><br>
Is there a need for child care for science fairs? The consensus seemed to 
be probably not. The bigger issue is child care during work hours. Kathy 
Prestridge will let us know what WDWG is doing. Kathy will also ask them 
about their awareness of LAWIS. Maria Rightley is the new WDWG Chair.<br><br>
<u>HONORARIA FOR NOONTIME SPEAKERS</u><br>
Peggy Van Hulstyn has asked for an honorarium and travel expenses. A 
motion passed to advise her that we do not pay honoraria for this purpose, 
but we would offer $.32.5 per mile and lunch either before or after her talk.<br>
<br><br>

<p>
<ol>
   <li><b><font color=red><a name="lunchtime"></a>LunchTime Talk Series</font></b><br>
LAWIS has a new organizer for our Lunchtime Talks: Roberta Mulford is 
doing a bang-up job getting a lineup of interesting speakers for the 
series.  If you're interested in giving a talk, you can contact Roberta by 
e-mail (<a href="mailto:u088247@lanl.gov">u088247@lanl.gov</a>). For all Lunchtime Talks, 
the venue (usually one of the Otowi Siderooms) is open from 11:30-1:30 for an early or 
late lunch and socializing.  Nonmembers are invited join us, so bring a friend. We 
realize that the 9/80 workweek doesn't give much of a lunch hour, but 
remind your group leader that LAWIS is a laboratory sponsored organization 
- and bring her/him along to learn something new.<br><br>
<b>PAST TALKS:</b> Friday, October 20, 2000: <i><b>Jean Dewart, ESH-17</b></i> spoke on "Air 
Monitoring Results from the Cerro Grande Fire." Roberta Mulford writes, 
"Jean Dewart gave an interesting and timely talk on "Air Monitoring 
Results from the Cerro Grande Fire". The talk was sparsely attended, but 
drew listeners from Santa Fe as well as Laboratory personnel. The 
experimental and logistical difficulties of sampling during the heavy 
smoke conditions were discussed, and both the raw and reduced data 
presented, enabling listeners to clearly see the origin and explanation of 
the slightly elevated reading of some radionuclides reported during the 
fire.  The isotopic ratios identified most of the observations as either 
natural uranium or naturally occurring uranium daughter products swept up 
from the ground during the high wind periods of the fire.  Jean gave the 
listeners and appreciation for the detailed process of making corrections 
for shielding of alpha emitters on the filter by layer of  particulates 
deposited on the filter by the heavy smoke, and corrections for the 
emissions produced by the filters themselves. Elevated air concentrations 
of gross alpha and gross beta measured during the Cerro Grande fire were 
shown to be consistent with measurements made at other forest fires. Air 
concentrations of plutonium and americium were not elevated above normal 
values."  <font color=green><b>Thank you to Jean</b></font> for giving the talk, and to 
<font color=green><b>Robi</b></font> for the report.<br><br>
<b>UPCOMING TALKS:</b> November 21, Sideroom A, 11:30-1:30, TALK from 12:10-1:00, 
<font color=red>Noline Clark</font> of C-18 will present a discussion, "Novel Technologies for 
Reducing Nitrogen Oxide Emissions in Automotive Engine 
Exhaust."  <br>
<b>ABSTRACT:</b> The U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments call for stringent 
emission standards for automobiles by the year 2004, specifically 
targeting nitrogen oxide emissions.  The automotive industry has focused 
its attention on "lean-burn" engine designs, where the combustion fuel to 
air ratio is significantly less than that used in present-day engine 
technology.  Existing catalytic converter technology does not work under 
these new conditions, therefore the development of new materials are 
required for the exhaust-handling systems.  The American automotive 
industry has partnered with the national laboratories in an effort to 
address this challenge.  Los Alamos has researched and developed 
zeolite-based materials that offer promising catalytic activity for this 
application.<br><br>
<b>AND FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD...</b>  Rumor has it that Robi has several very 
interesting speakers lined up through the Spring of 2001.  As soon as I 
can coax her into giving me a tentative list, I'll publish it so you can 
mark your calendar and spread the word.<br><br>

   <li><b><font color=red><a name="fema"></a>Good News from FEMA</font></b><br>
The New Mexico Network for Women in Science and Engineering had stored 
Careers books and book bags for EYH conferences in Tinka Gammel's garage, 
and they were lost when her house burned in the Cerro Grande Fire. The 
NMNWSE put in a claim for  losses of $5,683.59 on September 1, and the 
check for the full amount came on October 19th. Many thanks to <font color=green>Ann Mauzy </font>
and <font color=green>Tinka Gammel</font> for taking care of this claim.

<h2><A name=call></a>CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS</h2>
<p><b>Yes, yes, yes,</b> we know: no one has a single second of extra time these 
days - but for those of you who are interested in helping out nonetheless, 
check out these opportunities:<br><br>
<b>WISE ROUNDTABLE:</b> If  you are a woman graduate from the <b>Math</b> Department or 
from the <b>School of Engineering at the University of New Mexico</b>, this might 
apply to you: the School of Engineering is looking for a woman who has 
graduated from this department and is now working locally and able to 
become a member of the WISE (Women in Science and 
Engineering) Roundtable.  Do any of you know of anyone who might be interested?  The 
Roundtable will provide a forum for discussions of women's needs in the 
sciences and mathematics. Could be a good opportunity to do a little 
community outreach.  If you know of anyone, please pass their name and an 
email or telephone number onto: Roxanne Littlefield, Academic Advisor, 
Mathematics & Statistics, University of New Mexico, Humanities, Room 421 
Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, (505) 277-5250.<br><br>

<b><font color=red>URGENT: EXPANDING YOUR HORIZONS (EYH) REQUEST</font>.  The time commitment is not 
terrible (you'll be finished in March), it's fun, it's a wonderful 
learning experience, and you'll have a direct and positive impact on many 
young women in Northern New Mexico. "Wow, how rewarding," you're thinking. 
"What is this prize volunteer position?" Well, EYH Chair Dana Roberson is 
seeking a dynamic, outgoing, organized person to co-chair this year's EYH, 
which is scheduled for the end of March. As EYH Chair, Dana will probably 
shoulder the burden of the work, but I believe she's needing someone who 
has good connections throughout the laboratory community, to make 
organizing this year's event that much easier... If you're interested, or 
you know someone who might be, please contact Dana (<a href="mailto:dsroberson@lanl.gov"> 
dsroberson@lanl.gov</a> or 7-3935) for details, or get in touch with any of the LAWIS Steering 
committee members.</b></p>
