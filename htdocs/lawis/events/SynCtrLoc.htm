<P><font size=+1>Synergy Center Conference Room, 3rd floor</font><br>
Bldg 1 ("Motorola Bldg"), Los Alamos Research Park,
4200 West Jemez Road.</center>

<table><tr><td>

Get off the elevator at the 3rd floor, follow the signs to the
Synergy Center (two lefts) and enter through the door to rm 301. Sign in at the front desk (you don't need a badge - not LANL space - but they do like to keep track of visitors). The Synergy Center Conference Room is just beyond
the front desk (turn to the left past the front desk and it's the 1st door on the right. 

<P>&nbsp;

<P>
Use of the Synergy Center conference room was donated by the Synergy Center, an "economic development incubator" located in Rm 301, Bldg 1, <a href="http://la-rp.org/">Los Alamos Research Park</a>.
Contact the Synergy Center receptionist at 663-5001 for more information on
the Synergy Center, or see the Synergy Center webpages off the <a href="http://la-rp.org/">http://la-rp.org</a> - click on facilities, then select Synergy Center.

<P><center><font color="green" size=+1><B>You may need a parking pass to park at the Research Park!</B></font>
</center>

<P>
There are a limited number of 1-hour spots in the small parking area near the front of the lot which do not require parking permits. They are clearly marked as 1-hour spots.

<P>
To get a numbered parking permit for yourself in advance, you need to call or email the Synergy Center Representative at 663-5001.

<P>
To get a parking permit when you arrive for the event, park in the (15 minute?)
parking area just in front of the door to the Research Park
building, run up to the 3rd floor, get a permit, then go back to your
car and park it in a longer term spot as indicated on the permit, and return to the 3rd floor for
the event. 

<P>Apologies for the inconvenience - the Research Park is
working on improving the procedure to facilitate parking for legitimate
purposes while still protecting it's parking from "LANL overflow".
