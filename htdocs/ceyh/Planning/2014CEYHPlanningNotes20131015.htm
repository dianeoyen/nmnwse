<b>CEYH 2014 Planning Meeting</b><br>
10/15/2013<br>

<P><b>Meeting Participants:</b> Cheri Burch, Sara Chudnoff, Kelly Collins, Klaus Heineman, Laurie Marnell

 

<P><b>EYH 2014 Date:</b> At our last meeting we had selected February 1 as the date.  However, the STEM folks are having a Science Olympiad at UNM on February 1.  We looked at other dates and settled on January 25, 2014 as the best alternative, even though it means that Jeanne will not be able to join us.  Sara volunteered to fill in for Jeanne with presenters on the "day of".

 

<P><b>Presenter Recruiting:</b> Jeanne Banks is the lead volunteer.  Jeanne could not start recruiting until we had a definite date. Now that we have one (January 25), Kelly will reveal to Jeanne everything she knows about recruiting presenters for EYH.  We would still like to use the volunteer sign up form developed by Tinka for workshop presenters to use.  The completed forms should go to Jeanne.  Anyone who knows someone who would be a terrific presenter, please send name and email to Jeanne.

 

<P><b>Publicity:</b> Amy Tapia is the lead volunteer.  Publicity could not start until we had a date certain.  No one at the meeting is familiar with the publicity that has been done the past 2-3 years.  Kelly will follow up with Amy to see what has been done, what could be done, and how we can help Amy.

 

<P><b>Student Registration:</b> Rochelle Larson is the lead volunteer.  The Math Science Network was on vacation until yesterday.  Now that they are open, Rochelle will contact them and figure out how to get our registration on their site.

 

<P><b>Volunteer Coordinator:</b> Danae Davis is the invited lead volunteer.  If Danae accepts this responsibility, we are hoping that Pat can send the list of volunteers from last year and that everyone who wants to volunteer or knows someone who might volunteer, please send names and contact information.

 

<P><b>Day of Registration:</b> Nanette Founds is the invited lead volunteer.  If Nanette accepts this responsibility, she will coordinate with Danae on the number of volunteers needed to run registration and with Rochelle regarding workshop registrations.

 

<P><b>Student Materials:</b> Laurie Marnell is the lead volunteer. She is hoping to find funding for bags and for flash drives, so that we don't give out CDs.  Laurie will communicate with Nichole about the amount of funds needed.

 

<P><b>UNM Liaison:</b> Summer Little and Klaus Heineman are co-lead volunteers.  Klaus will reserve rooms in Dane Smith Hall and Maxwell Auditorium (for keynote address) and parking spots for special vehicles (veterinary clinic).

 

<P><b>Presenter Recognition:</b> Laurie Marnell is the lead volunteer.  Sara will assist. 

 

<P><b>Fundraising:</b> Nichole King Campbell is the lead volunteer, but would like to have a co-volunteer.  ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN WORKING ON FUNDRAISING, PLEASE CONTACT NICHOLE (via her email or CENTRAL_EYH-L@list.unm.edu).  Nichole needs to know how much money and/or stuff we need.  Laurie will put together the budget and send it to Nichole.

 

<P><b>Reporting:</b> Dana Roberson is the lead volunteer.  Klaus Heineman has done the analysis on the student feedback forms from the 2013 EYH and will provide that to Laurie and Dana.

 

<P><b>Adult Program:</b> Cheri Burch is the lead volunteer.  The adult program will include sessions on preparing for college and financial aid.  It will also include the tour of the museum.

 

<P><b>Local Web Site Creator:</b> We really need someone to create a web site for the ABQ conference that has a short, snappy URL, a young look and just has information about the ABQ EYH with link to the registration web site.  It could have the video that Danae Davis did last year and lots of photos that Danae took.   ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE CONTACT KELLY (via her email or CENTRAL_EYH-L@list.unm.edu)

 

<P><b>T-Shirts:</b> We need a T-shirt volunteer.  There are left over t-shirts from last year.  Zia Printing has the art.  This should be an easy job - any takers?

 

<P><b>NEXT MEETING:</b> THURSDAY NOVEMBER 14 AT 5:30 PM AT CDM SMITH OFFICE</b> (6000 Uptown Blvd)
