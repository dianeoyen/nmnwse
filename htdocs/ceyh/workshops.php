<br>&nbsp;
</LI><LI value=4><b>
Where the Wild Things Are (ML)
</b><br>
  When data is collected for animal populations of different species, a geographic information system (GIS) can enhance visualization of results in graphic representations. A GIS allows us to question and interpret geographically referenced data so that we can analyze and manage relationships and patterns to understand them better through our own critical thinking. Lets apply freely available GIS software to see what we can deduce! Then we can discuss how we might use a GIS in other scientific arenas.
<br>&nbsp;
</LI><LI value=7><b>
Why yes, as a matter of fact, You Can Be a Rocket Scientist (ET)

What it takes to be  a rocket scientist, some handouts, 
and a chance to build your own small rocket.
<br>&nbsp;
</LI><LI value=8><b>
Fun with Binary Numbers (CM)
</b><br>
   Did you know there are others ways to count besides using 0-9 digits? Information like the paper you wrote on your computer or the picture you took with your cell phone is stored in memory as binary numbers. In this workshop youll learn how to count in binary. Youll also learn a magic trick that demonstrates a simple way to detect and correct errors in memory.
<br>&nbsp;
</LI><LI value=11><b>
