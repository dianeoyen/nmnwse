In the 2nd block turn left into the parking lot (directly across from So. Capitol Pl.) for the Paul Bardacke Complex and the Attorney General's Offices.  If the gate is down and you don't see us, call Tinka at 505-690-1318 or find alternate nearby parking (not easy). Looking west (into the parking lot) you will see the main door  for the complex and the Attorney General's Offices (about 1/2 way into the lot, facing Galisteo).

<P> Note the historic name for the building on the Galisteo side of the  Paul Bardacke Complex is the Villagra Building, so you will also see this name on the Galisteo side of the complex just north of the parking lot.
