      <h2> Why donate to NMNWSE? </h2>
      
      <p>
        NMNWSE provides a professional development, networking, and mentoring resource
        for women and girls in New Mexico who are working or interested in STEM
        (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and allied professions
        including the biological, behavioral, medical, and social sciences.
        Our major membership activity is an
        <a href="http://nmnwse.org/AM">annual meeting and technical symposium</a>
        held each fall where members and students present papers and network.
        In cooperation with the New Mexico Governor's Commission on the Status of Women,
        we give out an annual
        <a href="http://nmnwse.org/ImpactAward">IMPACT! Award</a>
        recognizing outstanding New Mexico women.
        We also host local chapter activities such as talks and meetings.
        Our major outreach activity is holding annual
        <a href="http://nmnwse.org/eyh">Expanding Your Horizons (EYH)</a>
        technical career workshops for young women,
        licensed from the National EYH Network.
        <! 20,000 in 2008, roughly 1000/yr additional >
        Since 1980 over 25,000 students and their teachers have attended the free or low-cost NMNWSE EYH conferences.
