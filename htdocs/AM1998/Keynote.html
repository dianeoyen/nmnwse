<P>Ms. Banks will discuss the year 2000--what's real and what's not.
She will discuss much of the information and misinformation that is
currently being promoted about what will happen to computer systems
in the year 2000.</P>

<P>Ms. Banks has recently returned to Albuquerque after a five and a
half year absence. Currently for BDM/TRW she is managing BDM's
program efforts to do the Y2K conversion of the unemployment claims
system of the State of New Mexico's Department of Labor. For the past
year and a half, even though she technically lived in Placitas, Ms.
Banks traveled the country managing all of BDM's Y2K testing and
validation teams. With up to 15 teams in the field at any one time,
Ms. Banks oversaw Y2K conversions for such commercial customers as
Sprint, Bell Atlantic, National Insurance, Delta Airlines, and Banc
1; public sector customers such as the Ohio Department of Human
Services, Arkansas Department of Human Services, and Virginia
Department of Motor Vehicles; and federal customers such as the Air
Force Communications Agency, Department of the Army Information
Systems Command, and the Air Force Operation Test and Evaluation
Center. For the four years prior to her Y2K work, Ms. Banks supported
BDM's Omnibus contract with the Joint Interoperability Test Command
on site at Ft. Huachuca, Arizona. Ms. Banks received her B.S. degrees
in Computer Science and Mathematics from New Mexico State University
in 1976 and has worked for BDM for twenty years. She is also a past
Network State Board member and chaired the Albuquerque EYH in 1992
