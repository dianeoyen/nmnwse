<P>Located at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge north of
Socorro, the University of New Mexico's Sevilleta Long-Term
Ecological Research site (LTER) is part of the U.S. National Science
Foundation LTER network. Scientists of the LTER program investigate
ecosystem responses to environmental changes. These changes include
both natural and human disturbances such as global warming, acid
deposition, land use, wildfires, drought and the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. Long- term studies of the Sevilleta LTER improve our
understanding of the following ecosystems: Chihuahuan Desert, Great
Plains Grassland, Great Basin ShrubSteppe, Pinon-Juniper Woodland,
Bosque Riparian Forests and Wetlands, Ponderosa Pine Forests,
Mixed-Conifer Montane Forests, Sub-alpine Forests and Meadows.
Ecological responses to change are evaluated at various ecological
levels (organismal, population, community, ecosystem, landscape,
etc.) and at multiple spatial and temporal scales.</P>
