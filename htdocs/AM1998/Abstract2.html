<P><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></P>

<P>Based on current research and my own experience as a search dog
handler for over ten years, I will summa,rize how canines are used
for scent detection work, and how canine physiology and instinctual
drives, combined with rigorous training, make them well suited for
this work. This talk will briefly examine canine olfactory physiology
and how dogs detect human scent. It will also cover factors that
affect scent, including terrain, moisture, and wind, and also how
conditions affect the canines ability to find, follow, and
distinguish scent. Then I will talk about the various uses of canines
for scent work, and the requirements for an effective scent detection
dog. I will also cover the basic components of training a dog for
scent detection work, and talk a little about my own experiences with
search and rescue canines. Finally, using my certified search dog,
Miranda, I will demonstrate canine scent detection and
discrimination, canine alerts, and search techniques.</P>
