<P><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></P>

<P>The Advanced Recovery and Integrated Extraction System (ARIES) was
developed at Los Alamos to demonstrate technologies involved in the
dismantlement of nuclear weapons components and the conversion of the
plutonium to unclassified forms for long term storage or disposition.
One module of ARIES is the Nondestructive Assay (NDA) System. This
system consists of four computer based nondestructive assay
instruments, a robot to load and unload the instruments, and a host
computer for central control.</P>

<P>A plutonium sample is moved into the NDA System by a technician;
then data such as sample identification and analyses requested will
be entered into the host computer. The host computer schedules
assays, keeps track of the status of the four instruments, requests
loading and unloading of the instruments by the robot, archives
results, and prints reports.</P>

<P>The three axes of the robot are arranged as an overhead gantry in
a Cartesian configuration. A gripper, force sensor, and digit camera
are attached to the z-axis. The force sensor is used to detect
collisions and contact with an item to be gripped. The camera is used
to read the matrix identification codes ori the top of the
containers.</P>

<P>The presentation will discuss the components of the NDA System.
