<P><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></P>

<P>A simulation model was developed to characterize a range of
solutions to the hypothesis that Atlantic menhaden, <I>Brevoortia
tyrranus, </I>are a sign)ficant consumer of primary productivity in
Chesapeake Bay and that ecologically integrated management of the
fishery could reduce eutrophication in the estuary. The model
consisted of two components, one for prejuvenile menhaden (age-0) and
another for juvenile and adult menhaden (age 1-3). The prejuvenile
component was based on parameters determined from the literature,
while the juvenile and adult component was developed through
parameter estimation based on growth data provided by the National
Marine Fisheries Service.</P>

<P>The simulation of the population of age-0 menhaden indicated that
this cohort could remove 1.5 - 39.1% of primary productivity over the
model run. The value of the removal of nitrogen (N) in phytoplankton
by age-0 menhaden ranged from $1.17 to 15.0 million, while the
commercial value of the fishery ranged from $0.41 to 5.03 million.
Management adjustments in the simulation indicated that an unfished
population could remove about 3-4% more phytoplankton than a fished
one.</P>

<P>The age 1-3 simulated population could consume 13.3 - 193% of
primary productivity over the model run. The value of the removal of
nitrogen (N) by this population ranged from $10.3 to 74.3 million,
while the commercial value of the fishery ranged from $20 to 128
million. Management adjustments in the simulation indicated that an
unfished population could remove about 11% more phytoplanlcton than a
fished one.</P>

<P>Various management analyses and strategies were considered. No
single management policy was recommended.</P>
