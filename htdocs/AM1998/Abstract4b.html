<P>The Systems and Software Engineering Affinity Lab (SSEAL) at the
University of Texas at E1 Paso, funded by the National Science
Foundation, provides undergraduate and graduate students the
opportunity to engage in research projects and develop their
research, technical, communication, and group skills through on-going
structured activities. Built upon a cooperative group model, the
goals of SSEAL are (1) to increase the retention and participation of
traditionally underrepresented groups in the computing areas, and (2)
to provide a socialization and infrastructure mechanism for involving
students with a wide range of experiences, talents, interests, and
skill levels in research and outreach projects. The SSEAL
infrastructure takes into account issues that affect all students,
but especially those of underrepresented groups, and identifes ways
that research groups can effectively address persistence factors,
structure skill development, and provide a supportive environment for
enabling student success. Specifically, the SSEAL model provides
students with opportunities to interact with professors and other
students around substantive topics, educates students about the
benefits of engaging in research, and facilitates their understanding
and appreciation for the research process and its practice. The talk
will include techniques professors use to manage large-scale research
groups with students at varying levels of expertise and an evaluation
of students' experiences in the research group.</P>
