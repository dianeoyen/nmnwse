<P>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is the first of the
Department of Energy (DOE) Research Facilities to receive
certification authority to ship Transuranic (TRW) Waste to the Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). WIPP is a long-term geologic disposal
facility for TRU waste, located in Carlsbad, New Mexico. TRU waste
contains alpha-emitting particles with an atomic number of greater
than 92, has a half-life of more than 20 years, and are present in
concentrations of greater than 100 nanocuries (nCi/g) per gram of
waste. All waste that is designated to be stored at the WIPP facility
must be defense related. It can contain heavy metals and organic
compounds regulated in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) once a RCRA Part B permit is issued by the State of New Mexico
Environment Department. It can not be low-level radioactive waste.
Low-level radioactive waste is defined as waste that contains no more
than 100 nCi/g of alpha-emitting particles (i.e., Plutonium,
Americium, Uranium, etc.).</P>

<P>The Transuranic Waste Characterization/Certification Program
(TWCP) here at LANL is regulated by the DOE, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), New Mexico Environment Department (NMED),
and the Carlsbad Area Office (CAO). Periodic audits are conducted by
these regulatory agencies to ensure that the TWCP is following the
procedures they have published and are in compliance with the
requirements set by the regulating parties. The scope of these audits
includes waste characterization process, data analysis, acceptable
knowledge documentation and confirmation, packaging and
transportation, and waste documentation.</P>
