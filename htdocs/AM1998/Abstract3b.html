<P>The University of Texas at El Paso graduates the second largest
number of Hispanic students in the nation. The majority of students
come from families whose parents have not attended college. Most
students, who took the Fall 1997 General Biology course for science
majors, reported that they saw themselves going to graduate school in
the future. Yet the pass rate for the course is only 50%. Through a
major initiative funded by the National Science Foundation (HDR #
9550502) assessment and educational reform has been undertaken to
address the low success rate in this and many other science courses.
An examination of the academic background of students taking the
General Biology course and course outcomes was undertaken to
understand students' level of preparedness for the course. An
examination of historical data for the course revealed that most of
the students failing the course were concurrently taking remedial
math and English. Data from a recent survey showed that there were
significantly more women students who reported lower levels of
confidence in their abilities in biology, pre-calculus and calculus
than male students. Female students also reported lower levels of
confidence in their abilities in chemistry, and physics. These
differences were not found in self- reported levels of confidence for
speaking and writing skills. To address the issues pointed out by the
analysis, a series of remedies were developed, including the
requirement of prerequisites and the use of selected cooperative
reaming strategies in the General Biology course. Efforts have began
to understand and address genderrelated differences in students'
reported levels of confidence in science and math related courses.
The presenters will report on their ei:'forts to address low success
rates and seek input from conference attendees in the development and
implementation of successful strategies to remedy gender-linked
impediments to success.</P>
