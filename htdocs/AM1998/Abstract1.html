Navigate Their Way -<BR>

Beginning and Implementation of a University-based Mentoring
Program<BR>

<P><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></P>

<P>The primary focus is undergraduate women ages 18-25 with serious
interest in the physical sciences, mathematics, engineering and
architecture.</P>

<P>The goal is removing the anonymity from the student experience as
well as fostering mutually beneficial relationships between
faculty/community and students. A challenge of most mentorship
programs is/has been recruiting and then retaining mentors. A problem
we hope to address and solicit feedback on.</P>

<P>The intention of our program is to increase visibility of women
who are successful in scientific careers. By doing so, these
professions become accessible. Researchers have suggested that
entering students will fare better if they are to "get to know one
individual on campus who knows you are there and who cares about your
survival" (John Gardner, <U>Your College Experience: Strategies for
Success)</U>.</P>

<P>Previous programs at UNM show that women are more likely than men
to request and use such programs if they are available (see
One-On-One Program Results from 1988-89 and 1 989-90).</P>

<P>Mentoring is, by far, one of the most significant ways to bring
changes necessary for women to feel welcomed and a part of the
scientific fields.</P>
