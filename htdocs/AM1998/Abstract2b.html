<P><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></P>

<P>In 1972 the architects of the Clean Water Act included a triennial
review of water quality standards. They realized that very little was
known about the quality of water, uses of water, and how to attain
the quality to support the desired use. The triennial review was
intended to be a built-in feedback loop wherein knowledge gained from
implementing the Clean Water Act could be routinely incorporated in
the water quality standards set by each state. The New Mexico
Triennial Review is scheduled for September 21, 1998. The standards
set by the Water Quality Control Commission based on this triennial
review will be the standards New Mexico takes into the new
millennium.</P>

<P>Water quality in the new millennium has some tough issues to
tackle. The biggest is that 97% of New Mexico water does not attain
standards due to non-point sources. This means that only 3% of the
degradation of streams is due to point sources that can be
controlled. Non-point sources are not regulated and are difficult to
control. A second issue is setting standards that make sense for
ephemeral streams. Ephemeral streams have no self-sustaining fish
populations, so applying standards to protect fish is inappropriate.
Wildlife that use the ephemeral streams must be protected, but that
numerical standards applied should reflect the ecosystems that exist
in association with ephemeral streams.</P>

<P>The triennial review process involves the submittal of proposed
language changes to the Water Quality Control Commission. The New
Mexico Environment Department is required to submit proposed changes
to the standards. Any other person is allowed to propose changes. The
Water Quality Control Commission must sift through all of the
proposed changes and the testimony that supports or refutes those
changes to develop the final language that will be adopted as the New
Mexico Standards for Interstate and Intrastate Streams.</P>
